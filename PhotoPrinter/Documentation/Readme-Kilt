Kilt Release Notes

d45 (02 March 2001)
--------------------

Kilt now requires Carbonlib 1.2 or later (we validate against 1.2.5).

Try the new nametag tool -- rename your digital photos directly from Kilt!
	use tab/return/enter/escape to assign a name and move to the next image
	the ":" character is not allowed in any Mac filename
	
Rotation of an image within a grid layout respects the bounds of the cell,
	note that this is slightly different behavior than before.  Overlapping is no
	longer possible (wait for the collage layout coming soon!)

Make Finder Icons now makes Preview Picts as well!

Lots of bug fixes.

This build expires 30 Apr 2001

INCOMPATIBILITIES

CarbonLib is incompatible with XTND. You must disable the extension "XTND Interface" before
running PhotoPrinter. (You don’t need to restart your computer.) [drd 28jul00]


HP has finally released inkjet drivers which are better behaved, v4.13.
You will need Carbonlib 1.2.5 to work well with these.  
Turn "alternate printing" OFF


Epson printers still require "alternate printing" ON
