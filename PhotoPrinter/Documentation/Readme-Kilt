Kilt Release Notes


d57 (26 march 2001)

the gui is being reworked, and not all functionality has been moved to the new
controls, but this build is fairly well featured and a good indicator of the
direction we're moving in to ensure that Kilt is "the easiest way to print your
digital photographs"

OSX shipped 2 days ago, and though Kilt is pure carbon, we continue to experience
many problems when printing from OSX. we hope to have these resolved soon, but 
encourage you to use kilt from 9 or 9.1 if you want to print with this release.


Margin support is greatly improved.  There is now feedback in the page-options
panel for the numeric values of minimal and symmetric, and Custom Margins are now supported.
(Validation has indicated that many printers in fact do NOT perform as advertised, and thus
require manual setting of margins because minimal and symmetric won't work).

--------------------

Kilt now requires Carbonlib 1.2 or later (we validate against 1.2.5).

Try the new nametag tool -- rename your digital photos directly from Kilt!
	use tab/return/enter/escape to assign a name and move to the next image
	the ":" character is not allowed in any Mac filename
	
Rotation of an image within a grid layout respects the bounds of the cell,
	note that this is slightly different behavior than before.  Overlapping is no
	longer possible (wait for the collage layout coming soon!)

Make Finder Icons now makes Preview Picts as well!

Lots of bug fixes.

This build expires 30 Apr 2001

INCOMPATIBILITIES

CarbonLib is incompatible with XTND. You must disable the extension "XTND Interface" before
running PhotoPrinter. (You don’t need to restart your computer.) [drd 28jul00]


HP has finally released inkjet drivers which are better behaved, v4.13.
You will need Carbonlib 1.2.5 to work well with these.  
Turn "alternate printing" OFF


Epson printers still require "alternate printing" ON
