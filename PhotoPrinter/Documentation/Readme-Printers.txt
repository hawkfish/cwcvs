Thank you for using PhotoGrid, the easiest way to print your digital photographs.

PhotoGrid is designed to work with any Macintosh printer.  However, printers vary, so for best results, please follow the Printer-specific directions below.  

Laser Printers (all models and manufacturers)
------------
If you are using a Laser printer, please select the LaserWriter8 driver from the chooser.  

Epson Printers (all models)
-------------
Turn Alternate Printing on from the Printing tab of the Preferences panel.  Choose "Preferences..." from the Edit Menu of PhotoGrid, and click the printing tab.

HP InkJet Printers
-----------------
Turn Alternate Printing off from the Printing tab of the Preferences panel.  Choose "Preferences..." from the Edit Menu of PhotoGrid, and click the Printing tab.




Troubleshooting:
---------------
PhotoGrid is tested against the most recent printer drivers available from each manufacturer, so you should make sure that your printer driver is up-to-date.  

Try changing the value of Alternate Printing (Choose "Preferences..." from the Edit Menu of PhotoGrid).  Some printer drivers require alternate printing, some don't work well with it.
