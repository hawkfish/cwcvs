INCOMPATIBILITIES

CarbonLib is incompatible with XTND. You must disable the extension "XTND Interface" before
running PhotoPrinter. (You don’t need to restart your computer.) [drd 28jul00]

There are problems with HP Deskjet Drivers v 3.0 and v3.0.2.  Workaround is to use
the Generic Deskjet Series 900 printer v2.0a until HP fixes their driver.  
You can find the 2.0a driver at various driver libraries
on the net (hint:  go to google/mac and search for "hp printer driver 2.0a").
