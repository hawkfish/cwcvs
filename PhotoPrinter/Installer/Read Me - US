WelcomeWe hope you enjoy PhotoPress.If you don’t read manuals, we at least want to mention three keys to using PhotoPress: layout styles, drag & drop to import and rearrange, and crop-zooming to zoom in on a region of an image.If you have any suggestions for improving PhotoPress, please send us e-mail at photopress@electricfish.com.Trial VersionYou may try PhotoPress for 30 days. Once you realize how indispensable it is, you can purchase a copy that will never expire. You’ll need a credit card and an Internet connection. Just click the “Buy” button when PhotoPress starts up. (If you can’t purchase online, contact us at photopress@electricfish.com for other options.)Feel free to pass a copy of PhotoPress to your friends — they’ll also get 30 days to try it out. Please don’t give them your serial number — we rely on sales to support improvements in the product, not to mention putting food on the table.RotationDue to a bug in QuickTime, rotation only works for 90° increments. We are working with Apple to resolve this problem, and expect to soon re-enable arbitrary rotation in PhotoPress.TroubleshootingWe test PhotoPress against the most recent printer drivers available from each manufacturer, so you should make sure that your printer driver is up-to-date.  Try changing the value of Alternate Printing (Choose “Preferences…” from the Edit menu or PhotoPress menu).  Some printer drivers require alternate printing, some don’t work well with it.Electric Fish9 November 2001
