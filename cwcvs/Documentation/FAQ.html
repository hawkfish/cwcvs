How can I automate the configurationprocess?<BR><BR>A. The VCS Setup and VCS Environment panels are AppleScriptable, but theIDE is not recordable, so you will need to issue some Get Preferences todetermine exactly what your settings are. <BR><BR>The following AppleScript is what we use to configure the CWCVS project:<BR><BR><B><CODE>tell</CODE></B><CODE> application &quot;CodeWarrior IDE 3.2&quot;</CODE></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><CODE>Set Preferences of panel &quot;VCS Environment&quot; to {Variables:{&quot;CVSROOT&quot;,  &quot;:pserver:hawkfish@tuna:/home/hawkfish/cvsroot&quot;, &quot;IC_ON_TEXT&quot;,  &quot;1&quot;, &quot;ISO8859&quot;, &quot;1&quot;}}<BR>  <BR>  <B>with</B> <B>timeout</B> <B>of</B> 10 seconds</CODE></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>    <P><CODE>Set Preferences of panel &quot;VCS Setup&quot; to {VCS Active:true,    Connection Method:&quot;CWCVS&quot;, Username:&quot;hawkfish&quot;, Password:&quot;password&quot;,    Auto Connect:true, Store Password:true, Always Prompt:false, Mount Volume:true,    Database Path:{name:&quot;:&quot;, origin:project relative}, Local Root:{name:&quot;:&quot;,    origin:project relative}}</CODE></P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><B><CODE>end</CODE></B><CODE> <B>timeout</B></CODE></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CODE>end</CODE></B><CODE> <B>tell<BR></B></CODE><BR>Two things to note: One is that the IDE requires a timeout value for theVCS Setup panel, the other is that you need to enter a non-empty Passwordeven if you are not using one. An empty password will cause garbage to beentered in to many of the panel fields.<BR><BR><A NAME="configuration_slow"></A>Q. Why is it so slow?<BR><BR>A. CWCVS is not particularly slow, but some older versions of MacCVS useda 10 second sleep time when waiting for the network. When MacCVS was inthe background, this often meant that even simple operations could takeat least 10 seconds. This was fixed in MacCVS 3.1.6.</P><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <BR><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H2><A NAME="commands"></A>Commands</H2><H4><A NAME="commands_checkout"></A>Checkout</H4><P><BR><A NAME="commands_checkout_why"></A>Q. This is CVS! Why do I have to checkout files?<BR><BR>A. There are three reasons why you need to check out files: one CVS reason,one IDE reason and one philosophical reason.</P><OL>  <LI>The CVS reason for the Checkout command is that CVS does support exclusive  locking via watched files and such files need to be reserved with a <TT>cvs  edit</TT> command. Even if you don't use this feature, the plugin must  support it.  <LI>The IDE reason has to do with the fact that the VCS API was designed  for a system that uses exclusive locking, namely Visual Source Safe. The  IDE will only enable operations for files depending on the Checkout state.  Specifically, files that are marked as unmodified cannot be edited in the  IDE. I could report all files as unlocked, but this would give users no  feedback as to what had been modified.  <LI>The Philosophical reason is that I personally feel that leaving files  unlocked is a bad practice. If you are going to make a change to a file,  you should be deliberate about it. Hopefully, the time you take to make  that decision swamps the short time spent checking out the file. I think  that the Concurrent part of CVS is really cool, but I also appreciate the  virtue of not touching everything just because you can.</OL><P>While I appreciate that not everyone agrees with #3, the reason thatit is not an option is because of #1 and #2. By making the plugin extremelybaroque I could probably make everyone happy, but the time and energy involvedseems like a waste. More time is saved by not having to switch to the clientthan is wasted by the Checkout process.</P><P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<BR><BR><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><ADDRESS>This page was last updated on 6 July 2000 by <A HREF="mailto:hawkfish@electricfish.com?subject%3DCWProjector%20Bug%20Page">RichardWesley</A>. <BR>Copyright &copy; 1997-2000 by Electric Fish ,Inc.
