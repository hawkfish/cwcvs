We strongly recommend opening this dialogafter installing the 2.0b1 prerelease. At the very least, make sure thatthe options are reasonable. Consult the manual for documentation on thecorrect defaults.</P><P>As MacCVS and CWCVS communicate through a defined protocol and interfaceand as MacCVS is open source, we have made it possible for users who havetheir own CVS client to use the plugin by setting the client creator codein the CWCVS options dialog.</P><P>The Checkout and Undo Checkout commands now support watchers correctlyby using the <TT>cvs edit</TT> and <TT>cvs unedit</TT> commands. Checkoutno longer does an <TT>update</TT> (a feature I was never too happy aboutanyway), but Undo Checkout does because <TT>unedit</TT> is not guarenteedto restore the correct version of the file. The Properties command has alsobeen mapped to the <TT>watchers</TT> and <TT>editors</TT> commands.</P><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Prompt to add missing directories when adding files.  <LI>Add watcher support to Checkout and Undo Checkout;  <LI>Implement Properties to display editors and watchers;  <LI>Add -P and -d options as defaults for Get;  <LI>Implement default options dialog;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_0a3"></A>2.0a3</H3><P>MacCVS has an environment variable (<TT>DIRTY_MCP</TT>) that handleslocking projects, so I have removed the specical case locking code for theproject and replaced it with an implied <TT>DIRTY_MCP=no/yes</TT> environmentvariable based on the version of the IDE If you need to override it, youcan specify it in the VCS Environment panel. Any other automatically generatedvariables (e.g. <TT>LOGNAME</TT> and <TT>USER</TT>) can also be overridenthis way.</P><P>CVS has two label commands: tag and rtag. These are mapped to the recursiveand advanced recursive Label commands respectively. Full options are nowavailable in the dialogs.</P><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Replace project locking with <TT>DIRTY_MCP</TT> environment variable;  <LI>Implement Label dialogs for <TT>tag</TT> and <TT>rtag</TT> commands;  <LI>Implement advanced History dialog;  <LI>Fix bug revision retrieval bug in advanced Get;</UL><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_0a2"></A>2.0a2</H3><P>Recursive Get used to do a <TT>cvs update -r &lt;module&gt;</TT> butit this only works if there is a module with the same name as the LocalRoot directory. This has been changed to simply do a <TT>cvs update -r</TT>with the Local Root as the cwd. Advanced options have also been added toallow fairly complete access to the CVS options.</P><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Fix Get of locked projects;  <LI>Implement Advanced Checkin (commit) dialogs;  <LI>Implement Recursive Status;  <LI>Implement Advanced Status dialogs;  <LI>Fix Recursive Get implementation;  <LI>Implement Advanced Get dialogs;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_0a1"></A>2.0a1</H3><H4><BR>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Convert to C++ and CodeWarrior v7 API;  <LI>Implement Advanced Add dialog;  <LI>Default to <TT>-kb</TT> when adding non-TEXT files;  <LI>Simulate <TT>cvs login</TT> on connect with <TT>pserver</TT> method;  <LI>Lock project files after commit and update (MacCVS insists on leaving  them unlocked);  <LI>Report results of Recursive Get;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0"></A>1.0</H3><P>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Fix extra gray around text in dialogs.  <LI>Clean up registration dialog.  <LI>Remove communication logging in release build;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0b2"></A>1.0b2</H3><P><BR>The CVS/IDE conflict over deleted and renamed files continues. The old versionsare now deleted after tricking the IDE into updating their status.<BR><BR>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Remove files in Delete and Rename.  <LI>Fix Kerberos dialog crash.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0b1"></A>1.0b1</H3><P><BR>All of the changes in this release are cosmetic - making the dialogs matchthe IDE and so forth.<BR><BR>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Use ellipsis in menu for Label and Rename.  <LI>Match IDE dialog appearance.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0a8"></A>1.0a8</H3><P><BR>Until recently, many commands would fail almost silently because the pluginwas not scanning the CVS console output for aborted commands. This was implementedfor a few commands in 1.0a7, but a systematic conversion of all commandshas now been done. Commands that abort due to server problems (e.g. thedreaded Unknown Error (57)) will now report this as a failed command.<BR><BR>The IDE and CVS have highly incompatible ideas about how to a VCS deleteof a file. CVS believes that the files must actually be deleted, but theIDE will not update status for files that do not exist! The solution I haveadopted is to move the file to the temporary items folder, CVS remove it,put it back and then update the IDE. The delete has not been committed,and the only way to do so is with a Recursive Checkin, but the IDE seemsto behave correctly now.<BR><BR>There has been much debate over how CWCVS should handle kerberos. If a thereis not a valid ticket, MacCVS will put up the login dialog, which the usermay not see. On the other hand, CWCVS has no way to know if a connectionis kerberized outside of the &quot;:kserver:&quot; server method. Accordingly,CWCVS checks for a kserver method and puts up a login dialog if kserveris being used for the connection and there is no valid ticket in the cache.<BR><BR>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Check CVS output for errors in CheckIn, CheckOut, Difference, Get,  History and Status.  <LI>Rework Delete to leave the file around for the IDE.  <LI>Implement Label command.  <LI>Revert to kserver test for Kerberos prompting.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0a7"></A>1.0a7</H3><P><BR>The aete resource for the VCS Environment panel was not set up quite rightin a6, so I have changed it so that the list has a property name.<BR><BR>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Improve VCS Environment aete.  <LI>Fix kerberos prompting with non-kserver <CODE>CVSROOT</CODE>.  <LI>Fix cancel return codes.  <LI>Improve consistency of file states.  <LI>Added MacCVS error detection.  <LI>Implement Rename command.  <LI>Fix errors generated by user cancel.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0a6"></A>1.0a6</H3><P><BR><A HREF="http://www.strata.com/">Strata</A> has new released a version ofMacCVS that supports kerberos. To support this, I have added some code (courtesyof Miro Jurisic at MIT) to revalidate tickets in the plugin so that MacCVSwill almost always have a valid ticket.<BR><BR>The <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/soft-maccvs.html">current version</A>of MacCVS has been moved to the <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/">Cyclic</A>site. Please use it in future as the version at Alex's site is now for testingpurposes only.<BR><BR>There is now an environment preferences panel that CWCVS uses for its environmentvariables. The <A HREF="CWCVS.html#configuration">configuration</A> sectionof the manual has changed to reflect this.<BR><BR>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Difference command uses the -c option.  <LI>Kerberos ticket revalidation added.  <LI>Environment variables panel.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0a5"></A>1.0a5</H3><P><BR>The <CODE>CVS_PASSWORD</CODE> variable is now set from the VCS Setup passwordfield, so CWCVS is ready for <CODE>pserver</CODE> connections. MacCVS needssome small modifications which have been send to Strata, but this pluginbuild should work with both versions.<BR><BR>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>History command now uses CVS log &lt;filename&gt;;  <LI>Fix possible endless loop in version lookup;  <LI>Add <CODE>CVS_PASSWORD </CODE>environment variable;  <LI>Clean up newline/carriage return parsing;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0a4"></A>1.0a4</H3><P><BR>This version seems fairly robust. The Synchronize Status command has beenmodified to work with the local repository information and is several ordersof magnitude faster.<BR><BR>There is now a log file that is created in the Preferences folder calledCWCVS.log. If you find it is getting large, feel free to delete it. If youdon't wish to have logging enabled, simply replace the log file with a folderof the same name.<BR><BR>Make sure that you keep up to date with the Strata releases. I am generallyworking with the most recent.<BR><BR>This version will expire on 1 March 1998. We hope to have a released versionby then.<BR><BR>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Add logging;  <LI>Parse the results of the Add command;  <LI>About box now reads 'vers' data;  <LI>Synchronize status checks local Entries files (this is now much faster);  <LI>Restore old MacCVS creator code to match latest Strata build.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0a3"></A>1.0a3</H3><P>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Convert to work with new <A HREF="http://www.redrock.net/parentea/maccvs.html">MacCVS</A>.  <LI>Send comments on the command line.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0a2"></A>1.0a2</H3><P>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Initial public release.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><ADDRESS>This page was last updated on 9 February 1999 by <A HREF="mailto:hawkfish@electricfish.com?subject%3DCWProjector%20Bug%20Page">RichardWesley</A>. <BR>Copyright &copy; 1997-9 by Electric Fish, Inc.
