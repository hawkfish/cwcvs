As there is no room in the CWCVS Optionspanel for another checkbox, I have changed the checkbox under the diff optionsto toggle between cvs difference and helper difference. The default forcvs difference is now contextual, but you can change it in the advanceddialog.</P><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Implement Helper Difference command;  <LI>This alpha will expire on 1 July 2000;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_2"></A>2.2</H3><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Released.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_2b3"></A>2.2b3</H3><P>We finally have a Comment command. This is a wrapper for the <TT>cvsadmin -m</TT> command and will change the log comment for a given revisionof a file. The default revision is the one you are currently working on.Don't know why this took me so long.</P><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Implement Comment command;  <LI>This beta will expire on 1 February 2000.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_2b2"></A>2.2b2</H3><P>IDE 4.0.x has a bug in one of the callback routines whereby it does notprocess pending update and activate events for the IDE. If you checked outa file using the &quot;File is read-only&quot; alert after attempting tomodify a read-only file, this would cause the plugin to hang because thepending events would prevent the server's AppleEvent from being processed.Under the 4.0.x IDE I have added a hack to remove these events so that backgroundprocessing can occur. This may cause visual artifacts in odd situations,but at least nothing hangs any more. Hopefully MW will fix the problem,but their record on this sort of thing is poor.</P><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Hack around IDE 4.0.x callback event bug;  <LI>This beta will expire on 1 January 2000.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_2b1"></A>2.2b1</H3><P>I decided it was time to add the Finder label support from CWProjectorto CWCVS. The only problem is that the panel was originally designed foruse with CWProjector so half of the settings are not used by CWCVS. Still,this is a great way to find lurkers. This new feature is also why the versionnumber just jumped.</P><P>Finder labels are especially useful in the Contextual Menu plugin asthere is no IDE to show the state of each file.</P><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Add support for Finder labels;  <LI>This beta will expire on 1 December 1999.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_1_2b1"></A>2.1.2b1</H3><P>The Connect process for pserver includes code to validate new passwordsby issuing a <TT>cvs update</TT> command. There were several problems withthis code, including badly specified options, incorrect results parsingand slow performance. I have fixed the errors and removed the recursionwhich should make logging in via the plugin much faster and provide feedbackfor authorization failures.</P><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Change <TT>-n -q </TT>to <TT>-nq</TT> in the Connect command;  <LI>Scan for <TT>update</TT> errors in the Connect command;  <LI>Use <TT>-l </TT>in the Connect command to speed it up;  <LI>This beta will expire on 1 December 1999.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_1_1"></A>2.1.1</H3><P>Released.</P><P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_1_1b2"></A>2.1.1b2</H3><P>It seems that the cvs command line expects the global arguments to bespecified as a unit instead of separately. This meant that the recent quietingof the Get command introduced a small problem whereby files were not beinglocked during a Get or and Undo Checkout.</P><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Use <TT>-rq</TT> instead of <TT>-r -q</TT> in the Get command;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_1_1b1"></A>2.1.1b1</H3><P>I forgot to weak link the NavServices library used for configuring theplugin.</P><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Weak link NavServices library;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_1"></A>2.1</H3><P>I have been doing some internal code reorganization to support a contextualmenu module that I am making with the CWCVS source. This should not affectany behavior of the plugin.</P><P>A note on version numbering. Very little changed for this build but Ihave given it a 2.1 release number. The reason is that according to Apple'sdocs, major version numbers are for file format changes, minor version numbersare for new features and fix version numbers are for bug fixes. There isactually a new small feature (quieter updates) so I am just trying to dothis right. Sorry if anyone got too excited. Hopefully next time there willbe something more interesting...</P><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Use <TT>-q</TT> in <TT>update</TT> to reduce output clutter;  <LI>Use opt-Connect to configure Contextual Menu plugin;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_0"></A>2.0</H3><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Report <TT>cvs server</TT> messages as warnings;  <LI>Report <TT>cvs [server aborted]:</TT> messages as errors;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_0b2"></A>2.0b2</H3><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Add missing module argument to <TT>rtag</TT> command;  <LI>Hack around MacCVS launch/AE problem;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_0b1"></A>2.0b1</H3><P>There is a new CWCVS Options panel that you can use to set many of thedefault arguments for the commands. We strongly recommend opening this dialogafter installing the 2.0b1 prerelease. At the very least, make sure thatthe options are reasonable. Consult the manual for documentation on thecorrect defaults.</P><P>As MacCVS and CWCVS communicate through a defined protocol and interfaceand as MacCVS is open source, we have made it possible for users who havetheir own CVS client to use the plugin by setting the client creator codein the CWCVS options dialog.</P><P>The Checkout and Undo Checkout commands now support watchers correctlyby using the <TT>cvs edit</TT> and <TT>cvs unedit</TT> commands. Checkoutno longer does an <TT>update</TT> (a feature I was never too happy aboutanyway), but Undo Checkout does because <TT>unedit</TT> is not guaranteedto restore the correct version of the file. The Properties command has alsobeen mapped to the <TT>watchers</TT> and <TT>editors</TT> commands.</P><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Prompt to add missing directories when adding files.  <LI>Add watcher support to Checkout and Undo Checkout;  <LI>Implement Properties to display editors and watchers;  <LI>Add -P and -d options as defaults for Get;  <LI>Implement default options dialog;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_0a3"></A>2.0a3</H3><P>MacCVS has an environment variable (<TT>DIRTY_MCP</TT>) that handleslocking projects, so I have removed the special case locking code for theproject and replaced it with an implied <TT>DIRTY_MCP=no/yes</TT> environmentvariable based on the version of the IDE If you need to override it, youcan specify it in the VCS Environment panel. Any other automatically generatedvariables (e.g. <TT>LOGNAME</TT> and <TT>USER</TT>) can also be overriddenthis way.</P><P>CVS has two label commands: tag and rtag. These are mapped to the recursiveand advanced recursive Label commands respectively. Full options are nowavailable in the dialogs.</P><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Replace project locking with <TT>DIRTY_MCP</TT> environment variable;  <LI>Implement Label dialogs for <TT>tag</TT> and <TT>rtag</TT> commands;  <LI>Implement advanced History dialog;  <LI>Fix bug revision retrieval bug in advanced Get;</UL><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_0a2"></A>2.0a2</H3><P>Recursive Get used to do a <TT>cvs update -r &lt;module&gt;</TT> butit this only works if there is a module with the same name as the LocalRoot directory. This has been changed to simply do a <TT>cvs update -r</TT>with the Local Root as the cwd. Advanced options have also been added toallow fairly complete access to the CVS options.</P><H4>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Fix Get of locked projects;  <LI>Implement Advanced Checkin (commit) dialogs;  <LI>Implement Recursive Status;  <LI>Implement Advanced Status dialogs;  <LI>Fix Recursive Get implementation;  <LI>Implement Advanced Get dialogs;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="2_0a1"></A>2.0a1</H3><H4><BR>Change history:</H4><UL>  <LI>Convert to C++ and CodeWarrior v7 API;  <LI>Implement Advanced Add dialog;  <LI>Default to <TT>-kb</TT> when adding non-TEXT files;  <LI>Simulate <TT>cvs login</TT> on connect with <TT>pserver</TT> method;  <LI>Lock project files after commit and update (MacCVS insists on leaving  them unlocked);  <LI>Report results of Recursive Get;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0"></A>1.0</H3><P>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Fix extra gray around text in dialogs.  <LI>Clean up registration dialog.  <LI>Remove communication logging in release build;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0b2"></A>1.0b2</H3><P><BR>The CVS/IDE conflict over deleted and renamed files continues. The old versionsare now deleted after tricking the IDE into updating their status.<BR><BR>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Remove files in Delete and Rename.  <LI>Fix Kerberos dialog crash.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0b1"></A>1.0b1</H3><P><BR>All of the changes in this release are cosmetic - making the dialogs matchthe IDE and so forth.<BR><BR>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Use ellipsis in menu for Label and Rename.  <LI>Match IDE dialog appearance.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0a8"></A>1.0a8</H3><P><BR>Until recently, many commands would fail almost silently because the pluginwas not scanning the CVS console output for aborted commands. This was implementedfor a few commands in 1.0a7, but a systematic conversion of all commandshas now been done. Commands that abort due to server problems (e.g. thedreaded Unknown Error (57)) will now report this as a failed command.<BR><BR>The IDE and CVS have highly incompatible ideas about how to a VCS deleteof a file. CVS believes that the files must actually be deleted, but theIDE will not update status for files that do not exist! The solution I haveadopted is to move the file to the temporary items folder, CVS remove it,put it back and then update the IDE. The delete has not been committed,and the only way to do so is with a Recursive Checkin, but the IDE seemsto behave correctly now.<BR><BR>There has been much debate over how CWCVS should handle kerberos. If a thereis not a valid ticket, MacCVS will put up the login dialog, which the usermay not see. On the other hand, CWCVS has no way to know if a connectionis kerberized outside of the &quot;:kserver:&quot; server method. Accordingly,CWCVS checks for a kserver method and puts up a login dialog if kserveris being used for the connection and there is no valid ticket in the cache.<BR><BR>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Check CVS output for errors in CheckIn, CheckOut, Difference, Get,  History and Status.  <LI>Rework Delete to leave the file around for the IDE.  <LI>Implement Label command.  <LI>Revert to kserver test for Kerberos prompting.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0a7"></A>1.0a7</H3><P><BR>The aete resource for the VCS Environment panel was not set up quite rightin a6, so I have changed it so that the list has a property name.<BR><BR>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Improve VCS Environment aete.  <LI>Fix kerberos prompting with non-kserver <CODE>CVSROOT</CODE>.  <LI>Fix cancel return codes.  <LI>Improve consistency of file states.  <LI>Added MacCVS error detection.  <LI>Implement Rename command.  <LI>Fix errors generated by user cancel.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0a6"></A>1.0a6</H3><P><BR><A HREF="http://www.strata.com/">Strata</A> has new released a version ofMacCVS that supports kerberos. To support this, I have added some code (courtesyof Miro Jurisic at MIT) to revalidate tickets in the plugin so that MacCVSwill almost always have a valid ticket.<BR><BR>The <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/soft-maccvs.html">current version</A>of MacCVS has been moved to the <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/">Cyclic</A>site. Please use it in future as the version at Alex's site is now for testingpurposes only.<BR><BR>There is now an environment preferences panel that CWCVS uses for its environmentvariables. The <A HREF="CWCVS.html#configuration">configuration</A> sectionof the manual has changed to reflect this.<BR><BR>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>Difference command uses the -c option.  <LI>Kerberos ticket revalidation added.  <LI>Environment variables panel.</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0a5"></A>1.0a5</H3><P><BR>The <CODE>CVS_PASSWORD</CODE> variable is now set from the VCS Setup passwordfield, so CWCVS is ready for <CODE>pserver</CODE> connections. MacCVS needssome small modifications which have been send to Strata, but this pluginbuild should work with both versions.<BR><BR>Change history:</P><UL>  <LI>History command now uses CVS log &lt;filename&gt;;  <LI>Fix possible endless loop in version lookup;  <LI>Add <CODE>CVS_PASSWORD </CODE>environment variable;  <LI>Clean up newline/carriage return parsing;</UL><P><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A NAME="1_0a4"></A>1.0a4</H3><P><BR>This version seems fairly robust. The Synchronize Status command has beenmodified to work with the local repository information and is several ordersof magnitude faster.<BR><BR>There is now a log file that is created in the Preferences folder calledCWCVS.log. If you find it is getting large, feel free to delete it. If youdon't wish to have logging enabled, simply replace the log file with a folderof the same name.<BR><BR>Make sure that you keep up to date with the Strata releases. I am generallyworking with the most recent.<BR><BR>This version will expire on 1 March 1998.
