<H3>26 November 1999</H3>

<P>Three months is a long time when you're 14 months old much has happened
in Arthur's world since the last website update at the end of the summer.</P>

<P>In a local outdoor pool last September, Arthur took his first &quot;swimming
lessons.&quot; He spent time splashing, blowing bubbles, going down the
water slide, jumping in the pool, and generally having a blast in what felt
like a big bath tub with Mom and Dad. Pretty darn cute in his union suit
and swim diaper. Towards the end of the class, Arthur surprised us by holding
his breath and actually submerging his head for a few seconds.</P>

<P>We stretched out Arthur's 1st birthday celebration over the last week
of September and a few weeks in October as well. Thanks to everyone for
your generosity. Arthur enjoyed his first taste of cake (especially the
way it felt when you squish it) and really liked the balloons, bows, and
gift paper. We feel quite touched by everyone's generosity.</P>

<P>Athur has been steadily filling his playdate calendar and has a number
of friends who he visits with on a regular basis. Arthur now attends the
Infant &amp;Toddler Program twice a week at the Experimental Education Unit
at the University of Washington where Paula used to work. He's always very
interested in the contents of the sensory table, puzzles, and tools (a budding
engineer perhaps?) there, as well as the irresistable stuffed animals that
are brought out to play with--especially the stuffed toy duck. He also likes
playcourt where they have cool slides and tunnels, as well as art, and snack
time, and circle time.</P>

<P>Grandma Sally and some friends from one of Arthur's playgroups came for
Thanksgiving Dinner. Nine-month-old Hannah and Arthur had a marvellous time
together, including a 5-10 minute across-the-table giggle exchange during
dinner. They also spent a lot of time playing with Arthur's toy kitchen
and chasing the cats. Arthur loves the kitchen and we just know he's going
to make a great chef one day!</P>

<P>We're continually amazed at how much Arthur changes on a daily basis.
He can run, jump like a froggie, climb all sorts of things, and can go up
and down the stairs independently. He is also learning to feed himself with
a spoon , drink from a cup independently and his appetite is growing daily.
Mealtimes, as you can imagine, seem to take forever as he collect empirical
evidence on everything from what sort of trajectory your mush will have
when flung from your bowl across the dining room with your spoon, what happens
if you throw all your cheerios, grapes, crackers, string cheese, etc. in
your bowl of mush and pour water on it, determining the squish factor and
mouth and finger feel of foods, etc. !!</P>

<P>His expressive vocabulary is really growing fast and includes &quot;mum&quot;,
&quot;dad&quot;, &quot;cheese&quot; (accompanied sometimes by the AMSLAN
sign), &quot;more,&quot; &quot;done,&quot;&quot;down&quot; (usually pointing
where he wants to go--can also mean &quot;up&quot; &quot;downstairs,&quot;
&quot;off,&quot;&quot;on,&quot; etc. ), &quot;bye-bye&quot;, &quot;uh-oh&quot;
(thanks to Grandpa Tom for teaching him this important phrase), &quot;shoes&quot;,
&quot;see&quot;/&quot;kitty&quot;? (used for just about anything he is excited
by - cats, unnamed foods, airplanes, whatever) and today's new word &quot;outside.&quot;
His receptive vocabulary is also exploding. Arthur and he clearly uses non-verbal
means of communicating (gestures, pointing, grabbing one by the pinkie and
dragging one to request information, label, or action when he can't make
himself otherwise understood and is quite emphatic and persistent when Mom
and Dad don't understood--the nimwits. Most of the time however, Arthur
still uses less universal means of communicating. We call it Arthur speak.
The intonation, types of sounds he's making, gestures, and facial expressions,
all make you think you should be able to understand him if you'd just strain
hard enough. We're also having a lot of fun reading books with Arthur. He
definitely has his favorites--lately it's Goodnight Gorilla, Pat the Bunny,
and books by Sandra Boynton.</P>

<H3>27 August 1999</H3>

<P>Arthur has turned into quite the globetrotter. At less than one year
old he has already been across 10 time zones, from Hawaii in April to the
United Kingdom earlier this month. His whirlwind UK tour included stops
in Peterborough, Cambridge, Norwich, Higham's Park, Bath, Winchester, Bishop's
Waltham, Surbiton and London, and was a great success judging by the ooh-s
and aah-s of his adoring relatives. And the day before we all returned he
was able to meet Joan Kinstrie, one of his great-grandmothers.</P>

<P>Just in time for the tour, Arthur learned to walk so that it would be
easier to spend the ten hour flight running up and down the plane evading
Mom and Dad . Fortunately for Mom, Dad and Grandma, the flight over was
at night and he slept for most of it, but coming back he met everyone on
the 747 several times! Mom and Dad have also learned their lesson from the
Los Angeles diaper debacle (say no more) and were prepared for anything,
which meant that nothing happened!</P>

<P>Moving back in time, three weeks before the trip to England Arthur went
to a wedding on Mom's Dad's side of the family in Atlanta, where he was
again greeted enthusiastically by large numbers of cheering relatives. And
immediately after returning from Atlanta, the whole family jumped in the
car and drove out to Sand Point, Idaho for a family reunion of Mom's Mom's
family. Mountains were climbed and Lake Pend Oreille were explored, and
he met another great-grandmother, Lois Fisher.</P>

<P>Summer has allowed Mom and Dad to expand Arthur's food repertiore by
feeding him out on the deck. This is great for all concerned as any amount
of mess can be swiftly dealt with using the pressure washer attachment on
the garden hose! Arthur is now eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables,
all of which are fun to squish. And after a hard day of baby activities,
Arthur often splashes around in his wading pool, which also cools Dad off
after he rides his bike home from work.</P>

<H3>23 April 1999</H3>

<P>We all spent the week of the 16th on Maui and Arthur decided while Mom
and Dad were relaxing that it was time to start working on advanced baby
skills, just to help them out. In that one week on vacation he cut two teeth
(bottom front incisors) learned to roll over, sit up, crawl and started
practicing his &quot;cruising&quot; (walking while holding on). The cruising
is still limited, but he can stand and hold on to a chair and is working
on transferring his grip to another object (like Dad).</P>

<P>Mom and Dad are now frantically baby-proofing the house. The nursery
is mostly OK, but it is amazing how many innocuous looking things are dangerous.
Just this morning Dad found that the rubber tip of the doorstop can come
off and become a choking hazard. The crib has been lowered all the way and
a gate has been attached to the nursery door. Dad's office has also seen
the use of power tools and there is now a baby area with an ethernet drop
and a gate so that Dad can hang with Arthur and pretend towork occasionally!</P>

<P>This week has also seen the start of solid food. So far Arthur is more
interested in playing with food than eating it and has consistently turned
up his nose at the rice cereal. On Maui the natives were all extolling the
virtues of poi (taro root - the Hawaiian starch staple) and we are looking
around for some for him to try.</P>

<H3>22 March 1999.</H3>

<P>Arthur has been in an infant hearing study at UW Speech and Hearing Sciences
in Dr. Lynn Werner's lab.His hearing is testing normal and he enjoyed watching
the toy lion and bear light up when he heard a sound. He got a little distracted
by the cute baby in the one way mirror and didn't respond to the tones!
At any rate, Arthur got his UW graduate T-shirts a lot more quickly than
Mom got hers.</P>

<P>This is Arthur's first spring and he is enjoying nature walks with Mom
in the fine weather we have been having. Dad takes him out on the dock outside
the office and he really seems to like the boats. His favorite game right
now is making himself disappear under a diaper or a blanket by covering
up his head. Giggling starts when you say &quot;Where did Arthur go?&quot;
and play peek-a-boo.</P>

<H3>15 March 1999.</H3>

<P>Well, it has been a while since the last update and Arthur is growing
fast! At five and a half months he is 27 1/2 inches long and weighs in at
15 lbs. 12 oz. Doctor anderson thinks that his eyes will remain Hazel like
Dad's. Arthur, Mom and Dad have all been sick recently - Arthur is learning
to share.</P>

<P>Arthur's friend Ian LeMaster came over to play on Saturday night while
Ian's Mom and Dad went on a date. They had fun together and seemed to enjoy
smiling at each other and grabbing each other's faces. Arthur can pretty
much sit up by himself now and has a lot to say if only we could understand
it. He enjoys sitting up and concentrating on something like toys on an
excersaucer or swing. On the mobility front, he is now &quot;air swimming&quot;
on his tummy in preparation for crawling. He can also scootch himself around
a full 360 degrees on his back or on his tummy.</P>

<P>Arthur is facinated by other creatures, or really anything that moves.
People, cats and Dad's twitching feet have all been known to elicit grins
and squeals of joy. The cats have learned that he loves to grab their fur
and keep just out of reach. He has a lot of fun sitting in his baby carrier
on Mom's chest and watching her play this the cats with a &quot;fishing
rod&quot; toy.</P>

<H3>9 December 1998.</H3>

<P>Victory is ours! Grandma and Dad manged to convince young Arthur to take
a bottle while Mom was in the basement pretending to have a life. Dad was
the underdog going into this contest as he had lost the first round, but
with a new bottle and a thick skin he finally persevered. Grandma was along
as an observer and finished the feeding for Dad who was having a Gatorade(tm)
shower.</P>

<H3>7 December 1998.</H3>

<P>Today was a traumatic day for both Dad and Arthur as the first bottle
feeding was attempted. Preperations went fairly well, but the main event
was marred by technical ineptitude on one side and general snarkiness on
the other. Very little milk was actually consumed and much of the rest will
have to be removed from carpets, clothing etc. before the house starts to
smell like a cheese factory. Dad is nursing his wounds and Arthur is sleeping
it off. The latter should be well rested for the next round, tentatively
scheduled for tomorrow and both sides may wish to have Mom around as a referee.</P>

<H3>1 December 1998.</H3>

<P>Our son is becoming noisier! Mom the SLP notes that he is expanding his
sound inventory beyond &quot;chirping like a cat that has cornered a bug&quot;
(a technical term) to include grunts, squeaks, shrieks and wailing. Dad
has started referring to him as &quot;the piglet&quot; because of the sounds
he makes when eating. In his quieter moments, he likes blowing bubbles,
smacking his lips and sticking out his tongue. His hearing is also getting
more acute as he learns to turn his head towards new sounds and listen to
them, although he still startles at loud sounds. He also likes to make faces
with you and imitate your mouth movements if you get up close to his face.
He will even smile at you if he is in the mood and his smile is one of pure
happiness that is hard to resist!</P>

<P>Arthur is also becoming stronger and more coordinated. When we pick him
up, he can hold his head up and when he is underneath his play mobile he
can hit Big Bird and make him (her, it?) move. Splashing around in the bath
with Mom is also a great source of amusement, and we have started putting
his rattly zebra socks on his feet for him to play around with.</P>

<P>Appearance is becoming more human as his hair grows in and wrinkles recede.
He still has a bald spot on the back of his head from lying on his back
and his eye color is still indeterminate, which leads to Dad buy into the
idea that aliens look like children and are really just part of the collective
unconcious.</P>

<H3>7 November 1998.</H3>

<P>Arthur had his one month checkup yesterday and now weighs in at 10.75
pounds! It's amazing how quickly he is growing. Already we are seeing some
of his infant clothes looking a little tight and we are about to move up
to the next size of diapers from the service. Mom and Dad are getting better
at interpreting his moods, which makes everyone happier, and he is starting
to sleep for longer stretches of time.</P>

<H3>20 October 1998.</H3>

<P>Arthur can now track visually to the midline and he is more responsive
to his environment, startling to loud unexpected sounds. He has dancing
movements with his hands and feet, and can observe faces for 15 minutes
(or until dad's arms give out!) He often has a serious or earnest look on
his face - is this light sensitivity, or a predisposition to earnestness
from one or both of his parents?</P>

<H3>19 October 1998.</H3>

<P>At his three week checkup, Arthur is doing great, weighing in at 9lbs
even and measuring 22 inches long (a whole inch in three weeks!) He has
started to have periods where he likes to lie on the floor playing with
his arms and legs while his dad reads A.A. Milne to him. He is also eating
constantly it seems.</P>

<P>Paula had a bout with mastitis last week but has recovered thanks to
an antibiotic regime. Nursing is improving as we all get used to one another.</P>

<H3>16 October 1998.</H3>

<P>We went to UW Hospital today to show Arthur off at a class for Physical
therapists. He started showing tears and a bit of a walking reflex today.
In general, he is more alert, his eyes are less crossed, his hair is coming
in (including some downy porkchop sideburns). The noise repertoire includes
cooing, grunting, smiling and cute little baby snores.</P>

<H3>12 October 1998.</H3>

<P>Arthur has a belly button now!</P>
