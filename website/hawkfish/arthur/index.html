<H3>23 April 1999</H3>

<P>We all spent the seek of the 16th on Maui and Arthur decided while Mom
and Dad were relaxing that it was time to start working on advanced baby
skills, just to help them out. In that one week on vacation he cut two teeth
(bottom front incisors) learned to roll over, sit up, crawl and started
practicing his &quot;cruising&quot; (walking while holding on). The cruising
is still limited, but he can stand and hold on to a chair and is working
on transferring his grip to another object (like Dad).</P>

<P>Mom and Dad are now frantically baby-proofing the house. The nursery
is mostly OK, but it is amazing how many innocuous looking things are dangerous.
Just this morning Dad found that the rubber tip of the doorstop can come
off and become a choking hazard. The crib has been lowered all the way and
a gate has been attached to the nursery door. Dad's office has also seen
the sue of power tools and there is now a baby area with an ethernet drop
and a gate so that Dad can hang with Arthur and pretend towork occasionally!</P>

<P>This week has also seen the start of solid food. So far Arthur is more
interested in playing with food than eating it and has consistently turned
up his nose at the rice cereal. On Maui the natives were all extolling the
virtues of poi (taro root - the Hawaiian starch staple) and we are looking
around for some for him to try.</P>

<H3>22 March 1999.</H3>

<P>Arthur has been in an infant hearing study at UW Speech and Hearing Sciences
in Dr. Lynn Werner's lab.His hearing is testing normal and he enjoyed watching
the toy lion and bear light up when he heard a sound. He got a little distracted
by the cute baby in the one way mirror and didn't respond to the tones!
At any rate, Arthur got his UW graduate T-shirts a lot more quickly than
Mom got hers.</P>

<P>This is Arthur's first spring and he is enjoying nature walks with Mom
in the fine weather we have been having. Dad takes him out on the dock outside
the office and he really seems to like the boats. His favorite game right
now is making himself disappear under a diaper or a blanket by covering
up his head. Giggling starts when you say &quot;Where did Arthur go?&quot;
and play peek-a-boo.</P>

<H3>15 March 1999.</H3>

<P>Well, it has been a while since the last update and Arthur is growing
fast! At five and a half months he is 27 1/2 inches long and weighs in at
15 lbs. 12 oz. Doctor anderson thinks that his eyes will remain Hazel like
Dad's. Arthur, Mom and Dad have all been sick recently - Arthur is learning
to share.</P>

<P>Arthur's friend Ian LeMaster came over to play on Saturday night while
Ian's Mom and Dad went on a date. They had fun together and seemed to enjoy
smiling at each other and grabbing each other's faces. Arthur can pretty
much sit up by himself now and has a lot to say if only we could understand
it. He enjoys sitting up and concentrating on something like toys on an
excersaucer or swing. On the mobility front, he is now &quot;air swimming&quot;
on his tummy in preparation for crawling. He can also scootch himself around
a full 360 degrees on his back or on his tummy.</P>

<P>Arthur is facinated by other creatures, or really anything that moves.
People, cats and Dad's twitching feet have all been known to elicit grins
and squeals of joy. The cats have learned that he loves to grab their fur
and keep just out of reach. He has a lot of fun sitting in his baby carrier
on Mom's chest and watching her play this the cats with a &quot;fishing
rod&quot; toy.</P>

<H3>9 December 1998.</H3>

<P>Victory is ours! Grandma and Dad manged to convince young Arthur to take
a bottle while Mom was in the basement pretending to have a life. Dad was
the underdog going into this contest as he had lost the first round, but
with a new bottle and a thick skin he finally persevered. Grandma was along
as an observer and finished the feeding for Dad who was having a Gatorade(tm)
shower.</P>

<H3>7 December 1998.</H3>

<P>Today was a traumatic day for both Dad and Arthur as the first bottle
feeding was attempted. Preperations went fairly well, but the main event
was marred by technical ineptitude on one side and general snarkiness on
the other. Very little milk was actually consumed and much of the rest will
have to be removed from carpets, clothing etc. before the house starts to
smell like a cheese factory. Dad is nursing his wounds and Arthur is sleeping
it off. The latter should be well rested for the next round, tentatively
scheduled for tomorrow and both sides may wish to have Mom around as a referee.</P>

<H3>1 December 1998.</H3>

<P>Our son is becoming noisier! Mom the SLP notes that he is expanding his
sound inventory beyond &quot;chirping like a cat that has cornered a bug&quot;
(a technical term) to include grunts, squeaks, shrieks and wailing. Dad
has started referring to him as &quot;the piglet&quot; because of the sounds
he makes when eating. In his quieter moments, he likes blowing bubbles,
smacking his lips and sticking out his tongue. His hearing is also getting
more acute as he learns to turn his head towards new sounds and listen to
them, although he still startles at loud sounds. He also likes to make faces
with you and imitate your mouth movements if you get up close to his face.
He will even smile at you if he is in the mood and his smile is one of pure
happiness that is hard to resist!</P>

<P>Arthur is also becoming stronger and more coordinated. When we pick him
up, he can hold his head up and when he is underneath his play mobile he
can hit Big Bird and make him (her, it?) move. Splashing around in the bath
with Mom is also a great source of amusement, and we have started putting
his rattly zebra socks on his feet for him to play around with.</P>

<P>Appearance is becoming more human as his hair grows in and wrinkles recede.
He still has a bald spot on the back of his head from lying on his back
and his eye color is still indeterminate, which leads to Dad buy into the
idea that aliens look like children and are really just part of the collective
unconcious.</P>

<H3>7 November 1998.</H3>

<P>Arthur had his one month checkup yesterday and now weighs in at 10.75
pounds! It's amazing how quickly he is growing. Already we are seeing soome
of his infant clothes looking a little tight and we are about to move up
to the next size of diapers from the service. Mom and Dad are getting better
at interpreting his moods, which makes everyone happier, and he is starting
to sleep for longer stretches of time.</P>

<H3>20 October 1998.</H3>

<P>Arthur can now track visually to the midline and he is more responsive
to his environment, startling to loud unexpected sounds. He has dancing
movements with his hands and feet, and can observe faces for 15 minutes
(or until dad's arms give out!) He often has a serious or earnest look on
his face - is this light sensitivity, or a predisposition to earnestness
from one or both of his parents?</P>

<H3>19 October 1998.</H3>

<P>At his three week checkup, Arthur is doing great, weighing in at 9lbs
even and measuring 22 inches long (a whole inch in three weeks!) He has
started to have periods where he likes to lie on the floor playing with
his arms and legs while his dad reads A.A. Milne to him. He is also eating
constantly it seems.</P>

<P>Paula had a bout with mastitis last week but has recovered thanks to
an antibiotic regime. Nursing is improving as we all get used to one another.</P>

<H3>16 October 1998.</H3>

<P>We went to UW Hospital today to show Arthur off at a class for Physical
therapists. He started showing tears and a bit of a waqlking reflex today.
In general, he is more alert, his eyes are less crossed, his hair is coming
in (including some downy porkchop sideburns). The noise repertoire includes
cooing, grunting, smiling and cute little baby snores.</P>

<H3>12 October 1998.</H3>

<P>Arthur has a belly button now!</P>
