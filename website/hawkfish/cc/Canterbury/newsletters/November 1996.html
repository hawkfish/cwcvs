And Darby, from Memphis,is a childhood friend of Carrie.<BR><BR>Most surprisingly, however, Alexis, who comes from Las Cruces, New Mexico,didn't seem to know Chris C., who is also from Las Cruces (how is that possible?).Alexis is working as an engineer at Boeing and will be with us until Christmas.<BR><BR>Chris B., though new to Canterbury, is no stranger to Christ Church. Heis a long-standing member of the parish youth group. While still in highschool , Chris racked up sufficient credit at community college to allowhim to enter the University of Washington as a junior.<BR><BR>Two new Canterburians come to us from across the seas. Natalie, an MIT grad,is from Trinidad, and is pursuing a master's degree in environmental engineering.Kumbirai, from Zimbabwe, is a graduate student in Comparative Literature.<H2><HR><A NAME="Works"></A>In the works:<BR><IMG SRC="images/Works.gif" WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="155" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></H2><UL>  <LI>Jennifer will be coordinating another Canterbury Sunday, to be heldsometime in January.   <LI>Michelle will be doing a new poster for the front lobby.   <LI>Roxanne, Mary Shehane, and Linda will be developing a new Canterburybrochure.   <LI>Jennifer and Fiona will be laying plans for a possible winter retreat.  <LI>Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners are in line for Canterburians whocannot make it home for the holidays.   <LI>There will be a Halloween party at Jennifer's on October 25, 8PM.  <LI>Don't forget the Halloween pumpkin carving on October 30 </UL><H2><HR><A NAME="Congratulations"></A>Congratulations</H2><UL>  <LI>To Chris, on receiving his Eagle Scout award this month   <LI>To Lucas, on attending summer astronaut training at Godard Space Centerin Alabama.   <LI>To Bonnie, on her engagement to Fernan.   <LI>To David, for passing his preliminary exams in Statistics. </UL><H2><HR><A NAME="Rewind"></A>Rewind: Summer '96<BR><IMG SRC="images/Rewind.gif" WIDTH="117" HEIGHT="88" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></H2><UL>  <LI>Resident computer guru <A HREF="http://www.electricfish.com/hawkfish/">RichardWesley</A> invited the gang over to his office to create a Canterbury Webpage.   <LI>Chris C., a graduate student in theoretical physics, returned hometo New Mexico while preparing for the GRE and deciding on his next step(we still can't believe that Alexis has never met him).   <LI>Cathy, a seminarian in Berkeley, California, was home for the summer.  <LI>Paula and Fiona both recovered from serious illnesses.   <LI>Ervin was baptized in Canterbury lounge in June and turned 30 laterin the month with a bash at Roxanne's Flamingo Palace. </UL><H2><HR><A NAME="Camping"></A>Canterbury Goes Camping</H2>Who could forget the summer camping trip to the Oregon Coast?<BR><BR>Linda distinguished herself by confidently erecting a large tent while <A HREF="http://www.homer.washington.edu/~ome/">Owen</A>and Ervin, tired and utterly defeated, looked on.<BR><BR>The next day, a few miles up the road at Seaside, poor winds dashed Richard'shopes of flying his kite, but a tastey fish-and-chips lunch rescued theafternoon.<BR><BR>That evening, close quarters, the dark forest, a big fire and lots of gooeymarshamallows lent themselves perfectly to ghost stories.<BR><BR>The outing concluded with a serene outdoor Sunday morning service beneaththe trees. <H2><HR><A NAME="Simplicity"></A>Voluntary Simplicity</H2>Guided by Phoebe Gustafson, a guest speaker from the Earth Ministry, Canterburymembers began exploring the topic of voluntary simplicity. Thus far thediscussion has centered around what choices are involved in making one'slife simpler. The group will be dsicussing voluntary simplicity until theOctober 23rd meeting. <H2><HR>Next Topic</H2>On November 6, 13, and 20, Michael Wyatt, Dean of the Diocesan School ofTheology, will lead Canterbury in discussing the relationship between communityand scripture. <ADDRESS><HR>Copyright&copy; 1996-7 by The Diocese of Olympia.
