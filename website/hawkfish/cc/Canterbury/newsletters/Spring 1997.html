Canterburiansfeasted on shish kabobs, melted brie and hummus, marinated drumettes, anda nice birthday cake for Ellen Ewald.  It the third year in a row that Johnand Nancy hosted Canterburian who could not be home for this special holiday.  <BR><BR>Excitement was another consolation.  The group was entertained by the sightof a fairly large tree in John and Nancy's yard tumbling to an early deathin the now notorious wind storm. <BR><H2><HR>Other Events</H2><UL>  <LI>Michelle Stivers, who will soon be graduating from Dental School atthe UW, will be giving free dental exams as part of her graduaion project. She only wants people with bad teeth, so have more chocolate.  <LI>Linda Hallgren will soon be taking classes preparatory to gettingher real estate license.  <LI>Paul Hsi recently came up from his new home in Santa Rosa, Californiaand made a surprise visit during a Sunday morning service.  He is workingas a business analyst for Kaiser Permanente and is doing very well.<BR><BR><BR><BR></UL> <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>  <BR><BR><BR> <BR><HR><ADDRESS>Copyright&copy; 1997 by The Diocese of Olympia.
