But it was not a game. Itwas a way of showing the congregation our willingness to do service andplay an active role in parish affairs.<BR><BR>Organized by Jennifer Bannister, assignments were passed out early so asto allow for maximum preparation. Of note were Linda Hallgren, who gavethe sermon, and David Poole, Michelle Stivers, and Richard Wesley, who providedthe special musical performance for the service.<BR><BR><HR><H2><A NAME="News"></A>News, News, News!</H2><I>by Paula Rodda</I><BR><BR>Mike and Michelle Stivers are expecting an addition to their family thisspring. Canterburians are placing bets on whether the baby will be a Michelleor Michael Jr.<BR><BR>Nelson Hallgren's foot surgery went extremely well and his cast came offon the 18th!<BR><BR>Fiona Murphy has moved to North Shore and enjoys her new roomate and herhot tub. When she's not housesitting, Fiona continues to track &quot;Asthe Diocese Turns.&quot;<BR><BR>Mary Shehane has been given the Bishop's approval to go ahead with her proposalfor a teen drop-in center. Mary is looking into funding sources and possiblelocations.<BR><BR>William Kurtz is in his second year of grad school. Canterburians can continueto enjoy his weekly column in the University of Washington Daily.<BR><BR>A surprise farewell party was given for Carrie Morgan at Nelson Hallgren'son Friday January 24th.<BR><BR><HR><H2><A NAME="Voices"></A>Canterbury Folk Make Voices Heard</H2><I>by Owen Ewald<BR></I><BR>Three members of Canterbury recently joined the rotation of lay readers--JenniferBannister, Owen Ewald, and Mike Stivers. Under the able guidance of Rev.Steve Garrett and Frank Pollard, they were introduced to the liturgicalseasons, whose colors change like the colors of a landscape, fixed and moveablefeasts (no, a moveable feast is not a sub sandwich to go!), and how thereadings are determined. The training continued with practice in reading--howto be heard clearly in the back of the church, how to avoid the nervous,accelerating, &quot;runaway train&quot; style, how to pause meaningfully,and why it is important to look up from the lectern. A final exam cappedthe training. Having to plan a service with all the essential elements andto realize how all the elements fit together was very edifying, even ifthe exams themselves were consigned to oblivion along with last year's exams.<BR><BR><HR><H2><A NAME="Holiday"></A>Holiday Travel Digest</H2><I>by Paula Rodda<BR></I><BR>Several Canterburians traveled over the holidays. Michelle and Michael Stiversvisited with relatives in California, David Pool spent Christmas with friendsin Baja, and Chris LaTurnow flew home to Texas. Steve Greenwood visitedhis parents in Tennessee after having made it to SeaTac only an hour beforeit was closed down due to snow. Roxanne and Ervin went down to Portlandfor Christmas. We're glad everyone made it back safe and sound despite theweather.<BR><BR>For those who stayed in town, Nancy and John hosted a scrumptious ChristmasEve &quot;Do.&quot; Afterwards well-upholstered Canterburians headed forPaul's where he and Jennifer Bannister had prepared desserts. We arrivedat the Christmas Eve Mass with full stomachs!<BR><BR><HR><H2><A NAME="Sorrow"></A>Such Sweet Sorrow</H2>The Winter Quarter begins sadly for Canterbury, not just because the holidayseason is past, nor because yet another round of schoolwork has begun (thougheach is reason enough for lamenting). This time we creak and groan underthe burden of far weightier sorrow. Carey Morgan has decided to go backto Memphis to study physical therapy, and Alexis has already returned toNew Mexico to resume her studies in engineering.<BR><BR><HR><ADDRESS>Copyright&copy; 1996-7 by The Diocese of Olympia.
