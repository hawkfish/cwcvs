<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Canterbury Newsletters</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H1><CENTER>Canterbury Newsletters</CENTER></H1><HR><H2>What are they?</H2>Canterbury has a semi-regular newsletter/gossip sheet that we send aroundto all members. Periodically, all the various parts of the bloated Canterburybureacracy accidentally get organized and give Richard the computer readabletext of the newsletter, and after sitting on it for a few months he runsout of procrastination material at his office it up on this site for youall to read. <BR><BR>The newsletter has news about upcoming programs, reports on activities andgeneral gossip on who's been doing what with their lives. Despite the disclaimersabove, we are attempting to get organized so that the curious will be ableto learn more about us.<BR><HR><H2>What have we got?</H2><BR>Currently available issues: <UL>  <LI><A HREF="Winter%201997.html">Winter 1997</A>.
