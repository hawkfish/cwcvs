<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Christian Economy</H1>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>A Personal Journey</H2>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>by <A HREF="mailto:hawkfish@electricfish.com">Richard Wesley</A></H3>

<H2>Introduction.</H2>

<P>Good Morning. My name is Richard Wesley. I am a parishioner here at Christ
Church and a co-owner of a small software development business. I am here
today because I have spent some time thinking and reading about economics
from a Christian perspective and was starting to feel that it was time to
share my thoughts and experiences.</P>

<P>This talk is not meant to be an authoritative discussion of the subject
of Christian Economy, but rather a narrative of my personal journey with
economic thinking and how my faith has influenced that thinking. My hope
is that the books and ideas I will be discussing will provide a starting
point for some of you to start your own journey with this topic.</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2>The Old Testament and the restraint of Capital.</H2>

<P>When I was 13, my family took a 6 week train tour of Europe. Being a
rather bookish sort, I decided that this was a fine time to read the Bible
in its entirety (King James no less!) I suppose many people have tried this
and failed, as did I. I managed to get up to Ecclesiasticus before I gave
up, but along the way I read the entire Judaic Law. In addition to all the
prohibitions which generally wreak havoc with the minds of teenage boys,
the Law also includes a surprising number of economic regulations. Taken
as a whole, these regulations are an interesting description of an economic
vision quite different from what we see or read about today. Over the years,
my attention was drawn to a few of these economic laws.</P>

<H3>Gleaners.</H3>

<P>In the Law, and in the book of <I>Ruth</I>, we have a description of
the notion of gleaning - the cleaning of dropped grain from the fields of
wealthier citizens. The law prohibits wealthy landowners from being too
thorough when harvesting, requiring that dropped grain be left in the fields
for the poor to harvest on their own. The interdependence of rich and poor
is further underlined in <I>Ruth</I> by the eventual marriage of Boaz and
Ruth.To me this says that we have a community obligation to provide work
for everyone so that all can support themselves and contribute to the community.</P>

<H3>Year of the Jubilee.</H3>

<P>This idea that everyone has a right to support themselves is also present
in the regulation known as the &quot;Year of the Jubilee&quot;. Every seven
years, the land was supposed to lie fallow and every forty nine years land
was supposed to be returned to the family that originally owned it. This
is a very strange idea for modern minds and it was also quite strange for
the ancient Israelites. They generally ignored it and even in Israel today
there is an entire branch of real estate financing that allows conservative
Jews to return land during the jubilee and then get it back the following
year.</P>

<P>To me this argues that God's plan for Israel favoured individual self-sufficiency
and the attendant community strength over unfettered self-interest. Imagine
a country that lived this way: no individual or family could stay rich at
the expense of their neighbours for more than 50 years, so wealth must be
produced some other way than at the expense of the rest of the community.</P>

<H3>Usury.</H3>

<P>Probably the best known of the Old Testament economic laws is the prohibition
against usury - the lending of money at interest, or at least excessive
interest. In mediaeval times, usury was forbidden and until the last 20
years or so, there were often laws against it in this country. In fact,
just last week, a friend of mine was telling me about a credit card he obtained
in Arkansas a few years back with an 8% maximum interest rate enforced by
the state's usury laws!</P>

<P>Usury was the first law that I really thought about and started applying
to my own life. I decided at first that interest as a whole was bad because
it allows the lender to make money without having to take the same risks
as the borrower. The most striking example of this that I know of is the
story of what happened in Central America during the late 70s and early
80s. After the oil crisis, the OPEC members had huge amounts of cash which
they invested in interest-bearing accounts with US banks. The banks now
had to generate a return on this investment somehow, so they hit upon the
idea of loaning it to Central American nations. They got the US government
involved and tied the accepting of these loans to foreign aid of various
kinds. The money was often embezzled, lost or squandered and when the loans
came due, various austerity measures were implemented which lowered the
standard of living of the peasants. In some parts of Mexico, this decrease
reached 50% . There was little or no risk on the part of the banks - they
had the military might of the US government behind them - and the peasants
ended up suffered because of things which they had little control over.</P>

<P>Now, while I still feel that this argument has some strength to it, I
have since read a very interesting book on interest in the modern world
which presents a slightly different view on interest and I shall return
to the subject of usury in a few minutes. For now we can say that the Law
forbids usury as socially destructive and many Christians throughout history
have agreed.</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2>The New Testament and the dignity of the individual.</H2>

<P>Some Scandinavian once observed that if you are not a socialist in your
20s, then you have no heart. In my journey I am now in high school and college
where I spent a lot of time in fairly socialistic settings. Part of my interest
I think was inspired by the New Testament.</P>

<H3>The Gospels.</H3>

<P>Jesus' teaching at many points in the gospels enjoins us to care for
the poor and less fortunate. This teaching is in accordance with the Old
Testament law and with the constant accusations of Yahweh that the powerful
in Israel are despoiling the poor and ignoring them. &quot;Whatever you
do to the least of my brethren you do to me&quot; makes this message our
personal responsibility.</P>

<P>A second curious statement made by Jesus during the great commission
has also held a lot of meaning for me. He tells the disciples that they
are to accept whatever is given to them by their hosts. He also reminds
them that they have earned what they are given by doing the work of God
with the words &quot;The workman deserves his wages.&quot; God alone is
our source of value, not the market, and perhaps part of the task of creating
a Christian Economy is to make sure that people do not starve because they
follow the calling of their hearts.</P>

<H3>Paul's Letters.</H3>

<P>While Jesus encourages us to follow the calling of our hearts, this does
not mean that we have no obligations to our neighbours. In his letters,
Paul exhorts his readers to have gainful employment and to work hard for
the support of the Church and the less fortunate. He echoes the great commission
at one point when he reprimands his readers for accusing him of sponging
off them by pointing out that he earned his keep wherever he went. The calling
of your heart may require a lot of hard work and we must not forget this.</P>

<H3>Acts.</H3>

<P>Finally, no discussion of biblical economics would be complete without
mentioning the failed socialist experiment in <I>Acts 5</I>. The experiment
failed because a man named Ananias failed to turn over all the money from
a sale of land to the group. This failure has always made me wary of overly
idealistic views of how we should live. The second half of the quote I mentioned
a moment ago is that anyone in their 50s who is not a capitalist has no
head.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>C.S. Lewis and pragmatism.</H2>

<P>One of the great things that happened to me as a Christian in high school
was my introduction to the works of C. S. Lewis. I had read <I>The Lion,
the Witch and the Wardrobe</I> when I was a child, but I now began to read
everything I could find by this modern Christian layman. I would like to
draw out three ideas from his work that have influenced my thinking about
economics.</P>

<H3>Left vs. Right.</H3>

<P>The most radical economic idea I read in Lewis, and which has set the
stage for where I am today, was his critique of modern notions of left and
right wing politics. In his book <I>Mere Christianity</I>, he attempts at
one point to describe what he feels a Christian society would look like
and in this description he takes both the left and the right to task for
various blindnesses. He argues that the Right's elitism and acceptance of
excess luxury at the expense of one's neighbours has no place in Christian
society, but he also decries the moral relativism of the Left. Lewis was
speaking of pre-war British society, but these ideas are still part of our
postwar views and his criticism is still valid. More importantly, this critique
gave me the idea that the Christian attitude on political and social issues
should be prophetic and critical, rather than simply accepting of the lesser
of two evils.</P>

<P>Lewis' critique was deepened for me when I was living in various group
houses during college and graduate school. These houses functioned best
when everyone had individual responsibilities to the group rather than just
having everyone do everything whenever they felt moved. When individual
responsibilities were accepted (and they often was) these houses were some
of the most pleasant living arrangements I have ever experienced.</P>

<H3>An Unfallen Race.</H3>

<P>Lewis was more than an apologist - he was also a romantic storyteller
and in several of his fantasies he attempts short descriptions of what he
thinks a Christian society would look like. In the novel <I>Out of the Silent
Planet</I>, the main character spends some time living with an unfallen
race and provides short descriptions of what daily life was like for these
people. He presents a society of people who work hard, share with their
neighbours but devote time to adventure and art. In the two other books
of the series, he expands this vision to include the human race. It is a
compelling vision and one I highly recommend reading.</P>

<H3>Amateurs in action.</H3>

<P>The final idea from Lewis that I would like to share with you is the
idea that it is up to us, the lay folk of the Church, to create this society.
As he writes in <I>Mere Christianity</I>, &quot;Christian literature comes
from Christian novelists and dramatists--not from the bench of bishops getting
together and trying to write plays and novels in their spare time.&quot;
We as laypeople need to deal with these issues ourselves. God will help
us if we but ask.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Interlude in the job market.</H2>

<P>In 1989 I finally realised that I wasn't happy in graduate school and
made my way out to Seattle to seek my fortune in the software industry.
I still haven't made it yet, but I have managed to create a life that is
both financially stable and humane. The process that I went through to get
to this point involved the interplay of the inspirational background that
I have just given you with some real life experiences and some secular readings.</P>

<P>My first rude economic awakening came was when I was fired from my first
job. The company had hired me to write a very interesting piece of software
and for three years I was happy as a clam doing speech research and writing
code. Then the money ran out and most of the engineers were let go, despite
the fact that we were the only valuable assets that the company had. I realised
our value at the time and I eventually managed to use it to my advantage,
but the romance of working for that company was gone. I now recognised that
as a saleried employee I had no power and thus resolved to work for myself
in the future if it was at all possible.</P>

<P>I later had another year and a half of employment with another company
and while it was pleasant enough, I eventually quit. The main reason that
I left was that I was tired of having my input and that of my co-workers
ignored by a genial but clueless management.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>The Federal Reserve and the Social Contract.</H2>

<P>At this point I became permanently self-employed. This was a very frightening
decision for me as I have a lot of deep seated insecurities, especially
when it comes to money. Through prayer and the support of my friends and
Christ Church, I took the plunge and God has been faithful to me and led
me to where I am today. Along the way I was inspired to read some books
that have helped me understand the world around me, how it works, how it
doesn't work and how I can live my life as a lay Christian in the world,
both faithfully and prophetically. I should warn you that at this point
things are going to get a bit technical, although I will try not to put
you to sleep with the sordid details of the so called &quot;Dismal Science!&quot;</P>

<P>The first book I read was a massive tome on the Federal Reserve by a
former Washington Post editor named William Greider. The book is called
<I>Secrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country</I> which
received glowing reviews from just about everybody on the political spectrum.
The book alternates between a history of the Fed from its birth in populist
uprisings of the late nineteenth century and a meticulously documented description
of the rise of the power of capital at the Fed under Carter and Reagan.</P>

<P>The central idea in this book is that the Federal Reserve was created
to avoid democratic control of the money supply in this country. Because
the Fed sets interest rates, it can favour the success of one economic class
over another, and because in the 1980s its governors were appointed by the
intellectuals of the capital-owning class, its policies tended to favour
them. It is interesting to note that there are only two democracies where
the central bank is not under democratic control - the United States and
Germany (which modelled its post-war institutions upon the United States).</P>

<P>As a Christian, I found that the most interesting idea to come out of
this book was how the very rich exploit the merely rich and the rest of
us via interest rates. The very rich want their investments to be as safe
and as lucrative as possible, so they want high interest rates. Greider
points out at the end of the book that this is the old sin of usury, and
more interestingly he explains that the reason that usury is wrong is because
eventually it sucks all the money into the hands of a very few. Eventually,
there is nothing left for the rest of us to give these people and they choke
on their money because there is nothing left for them to do with it. So
not only is usury socially destructive, it is also personally destructive
for those who practice it. </P>

<P>This analysis also gives us a description of what is reasonable interest:
Reasonable interest is a rate of return comparable to the average growth
of the economy as a whole. Anything significantly higher is simply a means
to transfer money to the rich at the expense of the productive members of
society. This constraint is something that I try to keep in mind these days
when investing.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Psychology vs. Classical Economics.</H2>

<P>The next book I would life to share with you is a slightly obscure work
called <I>Adam Smith's Mistake: How a Moral Philosopher Invented Economics
and Destroyed Morality</I> by a psychologist and economist named Kenneth
Lux. Lux is by training a psychologist with a practice in Maine. While in
college, he had an interest in both psychology and economics and wound up
choosing psychology.</P>

<P>Several years later when he was established in his field, he decided
to study economics in his spare time and found that his psychological training
contradicted many of the basic assumptions of economics. One of the more
humorous examples is the notion of <I>diminishing marginal utility</I>,
which is the economist's way of saying &quot;variety is the spice of life&quot;.
A textbook illustrated this with an example of eating apples. After three
apples, we tend to lose interest in apples and move on to something else.
Economists like to say that this is because people get bored and move on,
but most normal people would laugh and say that after three apples we are
no longer hungry. Classical economists, it appears, are not normal people...</P>

<P>Lux sums up these examples of economic thinking by observing that economics
makes no distinction between wants and needs. He then proceeds to trace
the history of want-based economics through the robber barons and up through
its modern apologists like Ayn Rand, showing in convincing detail how the
promises of a society based on greed are a not only a cruel lie but also
how the arguments for such a society are pure sophistry - the misuse of
words. Moreover, the ultimate economic expression of self-interest is theft
(euphemistically called <I>free riding</I> by economists) which economics
itself is powerless to prevent as it has no concept of morality. Morality
involves self-restraint which is meaningless in classical economics. Classical
economics, therefore, leads to chaos if not restrained by ethics.</P>

<P>Classical economics also produces another disfiguring of the human condition
in which labour is treated as a commodity like any other marketable object.
This is the origin of the popular expression &quot;wage-slave&quot;. Strangely,
most moral codes object to treating humans as objects to be bought and sold,
but there is very little recognition of this fact in our world today. We
just assume that this is just the way the world has to be and we accept
it.</P>

<P>The startling news is that this assumption is wrong. Towards the end
of his book, Lux asks what a society would look like in which people are
not treated as commodities. The answer is that not only have such societies
existed, they continue to exist and thrive today. And we as Christians should
take note that the most famous of these was started by a parish priest in
northern Spain. These Mondragon cooperatives are the subject of the next
book I wish to discuss, and I shall return to them in a moment.</P>

<P>Lux finishes his book by observing that the attitudes of classical economics
are quite damaging to individuals on a psychological level. When we are
all taught that conflict and greed are good, why should we be surprised
by the universal rudeness into which we enter every morning? And why should
we try to change it? In the most chilling observation of the book, Lux points
out that the problem with inner city drug gangs is not that they violate
our society's principles, but that they embrace these principles that greed
and conflict are good with a purity that frightens us. It would seem that
we need to inject morality back into our economic life at a deep level and
I believe that this is one of our prophetic callings as Christians at the
turn of the millennium.</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2>Cooperation: The Fourth Way.</H2>

<P>At this point in my journey, I started to be really boring at parties.
Anyone who said the wrong thing would get a diatribe from me on how we solve
problems in this society. My frustration was that we seemed to have only
two ways of solving problems, which I called the Platonic and the Darwinian.
The Platonic method of solving a problem consists of having a Philosopher
King (or expert) of some kind understanding the problem and dictating a
solution. The Darwinian method of problem solving consists of letting everyone
fight it out and see who wins. As I have mentioned, Classical Economics
is an example of the Darwinian method, and is ironically much favoured by
the political right in this country. The Platonic method (the darling of
the left) is drawing much flack in the press these days for the arrogance
that usually results from experts, who are not yet Philosopher Kings, being
given the power to control the lives of average people. </P>

<P>What I was looking for was a new way of solving problems that balanced
the needs of the individual and the community. Hybrid methods like the so-called
&quot;third way&quot; politics of Tony Blair and Bill Clinton seemed like
window dressing that neither empowered individuals nor created community.
What I wanted was a fourth way. At this point, a friend recommended a book
on the Mondragon cooperative system called <I>We Build the Road as We Travel</I>.
I read it and knew that I had found what I was looking for. </P>

<H3>Mondragon.</H3>

<P>The Mondragon cooperatives are a group of democratically owned businesses
in the Basque region of Spain. They were started in the mid 1950s as the
brainchild of a local priest who had a knack for community organising. From
the initial five members of the first coop, the system had grown to employ
over 20,000 workers in a wide variety of businesses, all organised around
a central bank whose assets are over US$2 billion. One of the more remarkable
things about this movement is that it was done in the teeth of Franco's
fascist Spain and the OPEC oil embargo. Everything was organised from the
ground up by the workers themselves, and the system has thrived and grown
for over 40 years. </P>

<P>I could devote an entire talk to the cooperatives and how they work (and
some of the problems they have), but I will try to describe the system quickly
and move on to how it fits in with Christian Economy. Basically, each business
is employee owned and democratically run. Profits are split between the
employees, the company and donations to the community. There are also higher
level cooperatives - groupings of companies that provide related services
or common needs like health insurance - the most prominent of which is the
central bank.</P>

<P>The basic decision making principle of the cooperators is called &quot;equillibrio&quot;,
which is Spanish for balance, but it means much more to them. From the beginning
it was recognised that they were trying to create something different and
so while majority vote rules, the ideal is to run things by consensus. This
involves a lot of work in building relationships with your co-workers and
can be a slow process, but the resulting community that is created seems
well worth the effort. This concept of equillibrio is very important - without
it the whole system just devolves into a weird form of capitalism. </P>

<H3>Christian Economy and cooperation.</H3>

<P>For me as a Christian, this system makes a lot of sense. Christianity
in many ways is a religion about relationships - our relationship with God
and its implications for our relationships with each other. Christianity
is also about Life and having it more abundantly. In his novel <I>Perelandra</I>,
C.S. Lewis presents a view of the Godhead as an ever changing dynamic life
that calls us to join with it. With equillibrio, we have a living, growing
system made of humans who are in relationship with one another and support
one another. Equillibrio is a dynamic concept, just as our relationships
are dynamic and it seems to me that this is the direction that we should
be heading in as Christian people.</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2>Conclusion.</H2>

<P>At this point on my journey I am attempting to put the things I have
learned into daily practice. My business is run cooperatively with a friend
and we have plans to change the bylaws to allow us to hire more people as
employee-owners. I find that while I am not becoming rich, I am not starving
either, and I am living more fully because my workplace supports me and
allows me the freedom to make choices about my life that are consonant with
my values. This fall I was able to take three months of paternity leave
and I now bring my son into the office for a few hours a day so that he
can be with me and my wife can go back to work part time. While there are
jobs like that out there, they are not very common. What would the world
be like if we could all do this?</P>

<P>Thinking about my son has given me a new perspective on some of these
issues of life, money and work. One of the things I hope to leave him as
my legacy is a sense that he does not have to take the world as given, but
that he has power to live his life in a manner consistent with and supportive
of his values. As a Christian poet wrote a few years ago:</P>
