<P>I have been a parishioner at Christ Church for about ten years. During
that time, I have served as a lector and sung in the choir, which is where
I met my wife Paula. Several years ago I also spent some time with the <A
HREF="../Canterbury/index.html">Canterbury</A> group, and in recent years
I have helped cook for various parish functions. Last winter I gave a talk
on my views on <A HREF="../ae/Economy.html">Christian Economy</A> to the
Adult Education group.</P>

<P>I was born in England and I lived there for four years before my parents
emigrated to this country. I spent my childhood in upstate New York. I went
to an <A HREF="http://www.sps.edu/">Episcopal boarding school</A> in New
England and studied mathematics in college and  <A HREF="http://www.brown.edu/">graduate
school</A> . When I realized that I wasn't cut out to be an academic, I
moved to Seattle and joined the information industry. Paula and I were married
two and a half years ago at Christ Church and we now live in Wallingford
with our son Arthur and our two cats.</P>

<P>For much of my professional life I have been self-employed. At the moment
I am an owner and the treasurer of a small contract programming company
in Fremont called <A HREF="../../../index.html">Electric Fish</A>. We have
been in business for about four years and God has been faithful to me in
this calling by making our work both enjoyable and moderately successful.</P>

<P>I believe that an important part of the Church's mission is prophetic
- &quot;to speak God's Word in the present.&quot; If elected to the Vestry
I will do my best to facilitate that mission and to be a good steward of
the parish gifts.</P>
