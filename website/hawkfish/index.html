I was born in Britain of English parents,so that means I'm from England. I moved to the US when I was about 4 becausemy father worked for <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</A> (which in the60's stood for &quot;I've Been Moved&quot;) I grew up in upstate New Yorkuntil about age 14 when I was packed off to boarding school. I then spentabout 12 years in New England being educated (passive verb) before I decidedto leave and come out to Seattle. I've been here since 1989 and as longas the US remains socially stable (a dubious proposition) I intend to stayhere as it is a nice town. If things start to degenerate further, I thinkI will keep going west. At the current rate of progress (8 time zones/33years) I should be able to die in England at about age 99. Its nice to havea goal.</P><H4><BR>What do you do for a living?</H4><P>Basically, I'm a <A HREF="Resume.html">geek</A>: I write software fora living. Its an souless trade, but someone has to do it. More specifically,I'm a Macintosh programmer, which in Seattle is kind of like owning a Hondabody shop in Flint, MI. Recently, I've started a company with my friend<A HREF="mailto:slithy@electricfish.com">Dav Lion</A> called <A HREF="http://www.electricfish.com/">ElectricFish, Inc.</A> and we would be happy to talk to you about doing macintoshdevelopment.</P><H4><BR>What do you do for fun?</H4><P>For the last 11 years I have been studying <A HREF="http://ucsu.colorado.edu/~tkd/USTF/Region_1/washington.html">Tae-Kwon-Do</A>,a traditional Korean martial art. I have a first degree black belt and willbe testing for my second degree in April. My instructor is Fifth Dan <AHREF="mailto:ntropp@nwlink.com">Ms. Nhumey Tropp</A>, the Head Instructorat Traditional Tae-Kwon-Do and Hwa-Rang-Do in Greenwood.<BR><BR>My other regular activity is singing (first tenor) in my church choir. Myvoice isn't too great, but I spent my adolescence trying to sing along withvarious squeaky rock stars, so I stretched my upper range pretty well.<BR><BR><HR ALIGN=LEFT SIZE="4"></P><H3>Sex, Politics and Religion</H3><P>Straight, but not narrow; Christian Anarchist; Episcopalian. <BR></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="http://www.eff.org/"><IMG SRC="freespch.gif" WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Free Speech Online/Blue Ribbon Campaign"></A></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT SIZE="4"><I>For more information, contact me at <A HREF="mailto:hawkfish@punchdeck.com">hawkfish@electricfish.com</A>.<BR>Copyright&copy; 1996-97 by Richard Wesley</I>.<I> All Rights Reserved.<BR><BR></I><IMG SRC="macmade-wht.gif" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></BODY></HTML>
