<h3>
21 January 2001</h3>
Lucas arrived home on Friday morning (January 19) and is already eating
up a storm.&nbsp; Mom and Dad are feeling a bit more like old hands this
time, but sleep is still a precious thing.&nbsp; Grandma Sally and Grandpa
Tom have each come down to stay for a few days, and to help us all cope.&nbsp;
Our enernal thanks to them and to Grandma Lynn for sparing Tom in the depths
of an Alaskan winter.
<p>Lucas himself is a fairly calm baby and was born with quite an appetite.&nbsp;
He is feeding very well and producing enough diapers to win valuable prizes
and coupons.&nbsp; He is already having "quiet alert" periods when he looks
around and tries to take it all in.&nbsp; We expect him to be starting
college in the fall!
<p><a href="../arthur/">Arthur</a> is fairly taken with his new brother
and keeps showing him toys (tools mostly) and asking to feed him and hold
him.&nbsp; Feeding is probably not in the picture for several weeks, but
we are touched by his offers.&nbsp; Arthur also is less inhibited than
Mom and Dad and occasionally asks Lucas to "stop" crying!
