<H3>Introduction.</H3>

<P>This is a summary of all of the version control systems available for
the Macintosh that I am aware of. Each system is described in its own section
along with my own impressions of the system. Links are provided to the vendor
pages (if any) and if you have your own opinion, I would be happy to hear
your comments or point to your review. Just <A HREF="mailto:hawkfish@electricfish.com">email
me</A> with the information.</P>

<P>The contents of the reviews are mostly based on my own experience. I
have used all but two of these systems (<A HREF="#voodoo">VOODOO Server</A>
and <A HREF="#vss">VSS</A>) professionally on more than one project. The
reviews of these last two are based on trial downloads, technical articles,
review of online materials and personal communications from users. My goal
with this page is to provide a convenient stepping off point for developers
researching Macintosh-based systems.</P>

<H3>Disclaimer.</H3>

<P>Electric Fish sells two shareware VCS plugins for CodeWarrior. It is
not our core business (2% of our annual sales) and we are much more interested
in promoting widespread use of version control in the Macintosh development
community than making money. But we thought you should know.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2><A NAME="cvs"></A>GNU Concurrent Versions System</H2>

<H3>Description.</H3>

<P><IMG SRC="cvs.gif" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="225" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">Also known as CVS. CVS is the GNU version control system. The source
is freely available and has been ported to just about every OS you can think
of. The source and all associated resources are maintained by a company
called SourceGear (SourceGear bought the old maintainer, Cyclic, in February
2000). CVS is quite robust as it is open source. There are several Macintosh
clients, one of which is based on the cross-platform GNU source. The others,
while open-source, are home grown.</P>

<P>From the Macintosh perspective, CVS is a TCP based client-server system,
and databases (repositories) are kept on a POSIX style server and are maintained
over TCP connections. CVS supports kerberos making it useful for development
over the internet. Servers can be <A HREF="http://www.macsecurity.org/mail/macosx-admin/apr99/msg00247.shtml">set
up</A> on Mac OS X (both server and the public beta.)</P>

<P>The system uses a copy/modify/merge paradigm, which means that several
users can work on a file at the same time, changes being merged back into
the repository. Conflicts are detected at commit time and must be resolved
before the commit will succeed. This takes some getting used to, but for
large project teams it is pretty much indispensible. CVS also has an excellent
import mechanism which is very useful for tracking third party source trees.</P>

<P>Data integrity appears to be quite good, especially in client-server
mode, although I have seen one or two reports of occasional RCS archive
corruption. CVS is used successfully to manage extremely large projects
such as the BSD source, whose repository tracks over 100,000 files taking
over 1GB of storage. If you are good with shell scripts you can configure
CVS to do all sorts of fun things, including running source files through
a formatter before checkin and automated change notification.</P>

<P>The biggest drawback of CVS is that its design is a bit long in the tooth
and the source looks a bit like central Asia (i.e. centuries of invaders
rampaging across it). It is also not so hot at maintaining complex versioning
information, such as &quot;product A, version X contains label P of module
M, label Q of module N...&quot;.</P>

<H3>Audience.</H3>

<P>CVS is well suited for cross-platform development projects with small
budgets or limited configuration or administration needs. Academic projects,
in-house development or net-based collaborations should consider using it.
CVS is also a good choice for tracking third-party sources like PowerPlant
or the Universal Headers.</P>

ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></H2>

<H3>Description.</H3>

<P>Perforce is a commercial version control system made by Perforce Inc.
It has been ported to many operating systems, including the Macintosh. Perforce
is a commercial product, but the free demo version is a two-workspace license.</P>

<P>Perforce is a TCP based client/server system and databases (depots) are
kept on a POSIX style server and user workspaces are maintained over a TCP
connection. Perforce has a multiple checkout scheme, so that while you must
check out a file from the system, there are no exclusive locks and conflicts
must be resolved at commit time. Perforce has a number of nice features,
including atomic commits (i.e. all files in a checkin set are committed
as a single unit), bug tracking and a really baroque scheme for mapping
the depot layout to the workspace layout. It is also insanely fast and due
to its use of a real database engine with two-stage commits, it is probably
the safest of the available systems if the server is run on a reliable file
system.</P>

<P>Perforce has been <A HREF="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/loadprog.html#plats">ported</A>
to a large number of OSes, (only CVS is available on more platforms). In
fact, the Perforce <I>server</I> has been ported to Rhapsody DR2, which
means that you can use it on all Apple hardware if you like.</P>

<P>The biggest liability of Perforce is that the server maintains the state
of the client's workspace. This means that you have no control over your
local work area, and if something goes wrong, it can be a bit of a chore
to clean it up. From a Macintosh point of view the scheme for storing resource
forks as separate files on the server is also somewhat weak and there is
no nice GUI front end for it.</P>

<H3>Audience.</H3>

<P>Perforce is a good choice for large scale commercial development, especially
cross-platform development. Because the demo version is free, it is also
an interesting choice for 1-2 developer cross platform projects.</P>

<H2><A NAME="projector"></A>MPW Projector.</H2>

<H3>Description.</H3>

<P><IMG SRC="projector.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">Projector is the system that is built into Apple's Macintosh Programmer's
Workbench. It has been around for a long time and is quite solid for a file
based system. Now that Apple is giving away MPW, it is also free. The database
specification is also published if you want to write your own parser.</P>

<P>Projector is a Macintosh only system and the databases are kept on the
Macintosh file system, usually on a file server. The databases can be manipulated
either with commands in the MPW shell or from a standalone AppleEvent server
called SourceServer. The system uses an exclusive locking mechanism, meaning
that only one person can be working on a file at a time. Branching, labeling
and report generation are all fairly well supported, although you may have
some scripting to do. As a file based system, it is also theoretically vulnerable
to database corruption, although this appears anecdotally to be quite rare.</P>

<P>Projector's major drawback is that it is not very fast for certain operations.
It is also Macintosh only, which may be a problem for certain kinds of projects.</P>

<H3>Audience.</H3>

<P>Projector is ideal for Macintosh-only projects with small budgets or
limited needs. College students, small development houses and hobbyists
should all consider using it.</P>

<H3>Description.</H3>

<P>PVCS is a commercial cross-platform version control system based on the
POSIX RCS system. It has been ported to the Macintosh by Synergex. PVCS
is used by many large organizations.</P>

<P>PVCS is a file based system. This means that it can be used as a Macintosh
only system, or with a mounted file system from another (non-Macintosh)
machine. PVCS works only on single files - there is no global (project)
information maintained by the system. It also has a highly configurable
mapping between archive files and the local workspace.</P>

<P>PVCS's main strength is it's ability to track complex configurations.
As an end user, this is often a pain to use, but integration departments
like it - which is a good thing as it takes one to maintain the mappings.</P>

<P>As a file based system, PVCS is also vulnerable to hardware induced data
corruption, although due to the architecture, this tends to happen on a
file-by-file basis rather than globally. Still, archives I have received
that were produced by PVCS have been &quot;dirty&quot; - garbage characters
and inconsistent line endings. I really don't see what it offers over more
robust systems like Perforce.</P>

<H3>Audience.</H3>

<P>PVCS can work for large organizations with complex configuration needs
that already have a commitment to the system on other platforms.</P>

<H2><A NAME="vss"></A>Visual SourceSafe.</H2>

<H3>Description.</H3>

<P>Visual SourceSafe (VSS) is a commercial cross-platform system from Microsoft.
The Macintosh version is maintained and distributed by Metrowerks. I have
not used VSS, nor have I encountered anyone who recommends it.</P>

<P>VSS is a file-based system, with the source maintained on a server, usually
Windows NT, but it can be hosted on a Macintosh file server. It provides
all the usual source control operations and supports concurrent development
(i.e. several users can check a file out and work on it simultaneously).
The Macintosh version has a nice looking client and the CodeWarrior integration
is excellent as Metrowerks is the client vendor. VSS provides a rich set
of configuration management tools. One can link variants of projects together,
so that project A can include a particular variant of project B. Access
control is quite complete as well.</P>

<P>As a file-based system, VSS is susceptible to data corruption caused
by client and hardware bugs. With VSS, this appears to be a serious problem
as the archives reportedly can get corrupted quite regularly. The only recovery
tool (which reportedly does not always work) must be run under Windows,
which is a serious liability for Macintosh only development. Data corruption
seems to not be so much of an issue with smaller databases, but this begs
the question of why use such a complex and expensive tool for a small project.</P>

<P>For a while there were announcements and postings from Metrowerks that
VSS for Macintosh would not be upgraded to version 6.0 because of code base
porting issues. It now appears that Microsoft and Metrowerks have come to
an agreement that will allow VSS for Macintosh to continue to work with
version 6 databases. This is good news as it prevents VSS for Macintosh
from becoming an orphaned system.</P>

Macintosh compatibility.</P>

<H3>Description.</H3>

<P>VOODOO and VOODOO Server are two commercial Macintosh-only version control
systems made by UNI SOFTWARE PLUS. The name &quot;VOODOO&quot; is an acronym
for &quot;Versions Of Outdated Documents Organized Orthogonally.&quot; I
have used VOODOO but not VOODOO Server (except the demo). It is the cheapest
of the commercial systems listed here.</P>

<P>VOODOO is a Macintosh only system and the database is stored using the
Macintosh file system. This means no special hardware (e.g. a Linux box)
needs to be bought and maintained. VOODOO uses exclusive locking of files
to prevent update conflicts and has access controls to prevent unauthorized
manipulation. Its delta storage system reportedly produces very compact
archives, even for binary data, which makes it useful for managing non-text
documents and images. It also supports AppleScript which can be useful for
project management.</P>

<P>VOODOO's big strength is in the management of project-level variants.
It defines a simple way of tracking different variants of a project (e.g.
prerelease, OEM, or multi-platform). Other systems require a superstructure
for mapping the version number of a file to a particular project variant,
which can be quite complex and unwieldy. The documentation is quite thorough
and there is even a pointer to the chief architect's ACM paper describing
this theory behind the system.</P>

<P>We found that the original VOODOO was often quite painful to use. Only
one user can access the repository at a time (no waiting/timeout mechanism),
the client application was extremely unstable and had to be rebooted regularly
(although we <I>never</I> lost any data) and the mapping scheme from internal
nodes to local file names required excessive time-consuming manual management.
Moreover, this mapping scheme (as of version 1.8.1v3) does not scale to
multiple users with large numbers of files. The feature set available from
the CodeWarrior integration was poor (no Recursive Get for example) and
we had to keep changing GUI's in order to get work done. Even Uni recommended
switching to VOODOO Server and the only reason we kept using VOODOO was
that we needed the variant feature which is not yet implemented for VOODOO
Server (or any other VCS system).</P>

<P><IMG SRC="voselogo.jpg" WIDTH="177" HEIGHT="105" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">Until recently, VOODOO was a file based system, but with the release
of VOODOO Server they have moved to a more modern and robust client-server
architecture. The advantage of a client-server architecture is that all
database transfers are bottlenecked, sequenced and can be committed robustly.
VOODOO Server uses a two-stage commit process on top of the Macintosh file
system.The server communication protocol is based on AppleEvents.</P>

<P>At the moment, the only client for the VOODOO Server is the CodeWarrior
plugin that comes with the product. This means that users who wish to manage
non-development projects (or even non-CodeWarrior development projects)
must continue to use the previous VOODOO release. Uni intends to create
more clients for VOODOO Server in the coming months and variants are in
development.</P>

<P>VOODOO's main weakness is that it solves a problem that may not require
such a complete solution, and the fact that it is Macintosh only system
makes its model for supporting multi-platform development less useful than
it might be if it were a cross-platform system. VOODOO also does not support
concurrent development which might make it less desirable for large teams.
The original VOODOO should not be used unless you need variants or are doing
non-development work with an emphasis on binary files.</P>

<H3>Audience.</H3>

<P>The VOODOO products are a generally useful version control system that
any Macintosh-only workgroup with the budget should consider using and VOODOO
Server may be a good choice for CodeWarrior projects. Despite its extremely
annoying behavior and implementation, VOODOO is the only thing available
for handling variants. I have also spoken with people who find VOODOO very
effective for non-programming projects because its GUI is accessible to
non-engineers and it can manage non-text documents very effectively.</P>
