developing PhotoPress, the easiest way to print
your digital photos. It will be published and distributed by
<a href="http://www.streamrocket.com/">Voyager</a>. (Dealer inquiries invited at 505-474-3194).</p>

<p>PhotoPress will run under Mac OS 8.6 or later, and runs as a native Mac
OS X application.</p>

<p>We're eager to have your help in testing PhotoPress before its release.
We use it every day, but we want to make sure you know that it is prerelease
software, and may contain bugs that could cause you to lose data. You should
back up your computer before running PhotoPress. By clicking &quot;I agree&quot;
below, you agree that Electric Fish, Inc. is not responsible for any losses
you may suffer as a result of testing PhotoPress.</p>
