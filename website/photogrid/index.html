Electric Fish is developing PhotoGrid, the easiest way to print your digital photos. It will be exclusively published and distributed by Voyager. (Dealer inquiries invited at 505-474-3194).
<p>
PhotoGrid will run under Mac OS 8.6 or later, and runs as a native Mac OS X application.
<p>
We're eager to have your help in testing PhotoGrid before its release. We use it every day, but we want to make sure you know that it is prerelease software, and may contain bugs that could cause you to lose data. You should back up your computer before running PhotoGrid. By clicking "I agree" below, you agree that Electric Fish, Inc. is not responsible for any losses you may suffer as a result of testing PhotoGrid.
