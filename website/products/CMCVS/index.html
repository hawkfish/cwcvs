<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>CMCVS 1.0a1</H1>

<P>Welcome to the CMCVS page. Right now things are a bit raw. The plugin
works fine, but configuring it is kludge using CodeWarrior for a GUI. Please
see the <A HREF="ReleaseNotes.html">Release Notes</A> for a description
of what is new.</P>

<H2>Download.</H2>

<P>There is one item in this package:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>CMCVS 1.0a1. This is the actual CMM plugin;
</UL>

<P>The archive is a binhexed StuffIt! archive.</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="CMCVSPrerelease.sit.hqx">Download</A> CMCVS 1.0a1.
</UL>

<P>If you do not already have the CWProjector package, you will need to
install it first.</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="../CWCVS/CWCVSPrerelease.sit.hqx">Download</A> CWCVS 2.0.1b1.
</UL>

<P>Note that you must use 2.0.1b1 because it is the only tool for configuring
the contextual menu plugin.</P>

<H2>Installation.</H2>

<P>Make sure you have CWCVS 2.0.1b1 or later installed;</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Copy the CMCVS module to the Contextual Menu Items folder in the System
  folder;
  <LI>Restart your machine or use the CMM SDK reload application to reload
  the plugin;
</OL>

<H2>Configuration.</H2>

<P>CMCVS only provides version control for folders that have a CMCVS project
file in the CMCVS preferences folder. To create a CMCVS project file you
must create a CodeWarrior project that is configured to use CMCVS for version
control. If the folder in question is part of a project with no CodeWarrior
project, just create a temporary CodeWarrior project and configure it. Once
you have a project file, just hold down the option key while connecting
and you will be presented with a Nav services dialog that will allow you
to save the current settings. If you ever need to change the settings, simply
hold down the option key again and use the dialog to replace the file.</P>

<H2>Usage.</H2>

<P>In the Finder, just do a control-click on any file or folder in a project.
Other applications should provide a context that can be coerced to <TT>typeFSS</TT>.</P>
