<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>CMCVS 1.0a4</H1>

<P>Welcome to the CMCVS page. Right now things are a bit raw. The plugin
works fine, but configuring it is kludge using CodeWarrior for a GUI. Please
see the <A HREF="ReleaseNotes.html">Release Notes</A> for a description
of what is new.</P>

<H2>Download.</H2>

<P>There is one item in this package:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>CMCVS 1.0a4. This is the actual CMM plugin;
</UL>

<P>The archive is a binhexed StuffIt! archive.</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="CMCVSPrerelease.sit.hqx">Download</A> CMCVS 1.0a4.
</UL>

<P>If you do not already have the CWCVS package, you may want to install
it first.</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="../CWCVS/CWCVSPrerelease.sit.hqx">Download</A> CWCVS 2.1.1.
</UL>

<P>Note that you must use 2.1.1 if you wish to be able to configure the
plugin to use anything other than the default settings.</P>

<H2>Installation.</H2>

<P>Make sure you have CWCVS 2.1.1 or later installed;</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Copy the CMCVS module to the Contextual Menu Items folder in the System
  folder;
  <LI>Restart your machine or use the CMM SDK reload application to reload
  the plugin;
</OL>

<H2>Configuration.</H2>

<P>CMCVS only provides version control for folders that have a CMCVS project
file in the CMCVS preferences folder. You must either create a project file
or allow the plugin to create a default project file for you.</P>

<P>With version 1.0a5, project files can be automatically generated the
first time you attempt to work with a checkout that does not have a configuration
file. This file uses the default settings for the control panels and looks
up the CVSROOT variable from the CVS:Root file. You must already be logged
in to the server as the username/password are not valid.</P>

<P>To create a non-default CMCVS project file you must create a CodeWarrior
project that is configured to use CMCVS for version control. If the folder
in question is part of a project with no CodeWarrior project, just create
a temporary CodeWarrior project and configure it. Once you have a project
file, just hold down the option key while connecting and you will be presented
with a Nav services dialog that will allow you to save the current settings.
If you ever need to change the settings, simply hold down the option key
again and use the dialog to replace the file.</P>

<H2>Usage.</H2>

<P>In the Finder, just do a control-click on any file or folder in a project.
Other applications should provide a context that can be coerced to <TT>typeFSS</TT>.</P>
