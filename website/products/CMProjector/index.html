<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>CMProjector 1.0a2</H1>

<P>Welcome to the CMProjector page. Right now things are a bit raw. The
plugin works fine, but configuring it is kludge using CodeWarrior for a
GUI. Please see the <A HREF="ReleaseNotes.html">Release Notes</A> for a
description of what is new.</P>

<H2>Download.</H2>

<P>There is one item in this package:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>CMProjector 1.0a2. This is the actual CMM plugin;
</UL>

<P>The archive is a binhexed StuffIt! archive.</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="CMProjectorPrerelease.sit.hqx">Download</A> CMProjector 1.0a2.
</UL>

<P>If you do not already have the CWProjector package, you will need to
install it first.</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="../CWProjector/CWProjectorPrerelease.sit.hqx">Download</A>
  CWProjector 3.2.
</UL>

<P>Note that you must use 3.2 because it is the only tool for configuring
the contextual menu plugin.</P>

<H2>Installation.</H2>

<P>Make sure you have CWProjector 3.2 or later installed;</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Copy the CMProjector module to the Contextual Menu Items folder in
  the System folder;
  <LI>Restart your machine or use the CMM SDK reload application to reload
  the plugin;
</OL>

<H2>Configuration.</H2>

<P>CMProjector only provides version control for folders that have a CMProjector
project file in the CMProjector preferences folder. To create a CMProjector
project file you must create a CodeWarrior project that is configured to
use CWProjector for version control. If the folder in question is part of
a project with no CodeWarrior project, just create a temporary CodeWarrior
project and configure it. Once you have a project file, just hold down the
option key while connecting and you will be presented with a Nav services
dialog that will allow you to save the current settings. If you ever need
to change the settings, simply hold down the option key again and use the
dialog to replace the file.</P>

<H2>Usage.</H2>

<P>In the Finder, just do a control-click on any file or folder in a project.
Other applications should provide a context that can be coerced to <TT>typeFSS</TT>.</P>
