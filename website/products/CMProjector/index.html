<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>CMProjector 1.0d4</H1>

<P>Welcome to the CMProjector page. Right now things are a bit raw. The
plugin works fine, but configuring it is kludge using CodeWarrior for a
GUI. Please see the <A HREF="ReleaseNotes.html">Release Notes</A> for a
description of what is new.</P>

<H2>Download.</H2>

<P>There are three items in this package:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>CMProjector 1.0d4. This is the actual CMM plugin;
  <LI>CWProjector 3.1.2d4. This is a prerelease of CWProjector that can be
  used to create CMProjector project files. Eventually, this will be replaced
  with a Control Panel;
  <LI>BBEdit Diff. This is a helper application that redirects the Difference
  command to BBEdit 5.0;
</UL>

<P>The archive is a binhexed StuffIt! archive.</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="CMProjectorPrerelease.sit.hqx">Download</A> CMProjector 1.0d4.
</UL>

<P>If you do not already have the CWProjector package, you will need to
install it first.</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="../CWProjector/ElectricFish.sit.hqx">Download</A> CWProjector
  3.1.1.
</UL>

<H2>Installation.</H2>

<P>Make sure you have CWProjector 3.1 or later installed;</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Copy the CMProjector module to the Contextual Menu Items folder in
  the System folder;
  <LI>Copy the BBEdit Diff helper to your hard drive;
  <LI>Replace your copy of CWProjector with the CWProjector 3.1.2b2 version;
  <LI>Restart your machine or use the CMM SDK reload application to reload
  the plugin;
</OL>

<H2>Configuration.</H2>

<P>CMProjector only provides version control for folders that have a CMProjector
project file in the CMProjector preferences folder. To create a CMProjector
project file you must create a CodeWarrior project that is configured to
use CWProjector for version control. If the folder in question is part of
a project with no CodeWarrior project, just create a temporary CodeWarrior
project and configure it. This should create a project file in the CMProjector
preferences folder with all the correct information.</P>

<P>If you need to change the information, change the CodeWarrior project,
throw out the file and reconnect in CodeWarrior.</P>

<H2>Usage.</H2>

<P>In the Finder, just do a control-click on any file or folder in a project.
Other applications should provide a context that can be coerced to <TT>typeFSS</TT>.</P>
