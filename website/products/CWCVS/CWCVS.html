<P><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.electricfish.com/hawkfish/CWCVS/Download.html">CWCVS</A>
is a version control plugin for <A HREF="http://www.metrowerks.com/">Metrowerks</A>
CodeWarrior which allows you to use <A HREF="http://www.strata.com/">Strata</A>'s
public domain <A HREF="http://www.digapp.com/maccvs/">MacCVS</A> CVS client
for source control without leaving the CodeWarrior IDE. <BR>
<BR>
CVS is a widely used POSIX-based source control system and CVS clients are
available on many platforms, including the Macintosh, making it a reasonable
choice for multiple platform development. CWCVS allows Macintosh developers
to use CVS with CodeWarrior without arcane command line arguments or scripts.</P>

<P>CVS is not a simple system. We have attempted to make the interface in
CWCVS fairly easy to use and we have automated a couple of gotchas (directory
creation for example) but we strongly recommend reading the CVS <A HREF=
"http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/doc-cederqvist.html">documentation</A> before
getting in too deep.<BR>

<P>CWCVS provides access to the the standard functions of most source-code
control systems:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Get copies
  <LI>File management (Add, Rename, Delete)
  <LI>Check out/in
  <LI>Report generation

<H2><A NAME="requirements"></A>Requirements.</H2>

<P><BR>
CWCVS requires a version of the CodeWarrior IDE that supports the VCS plugin
architecture. This means version 1.7.4 (CodeWarrior Gold 11) or later. <BR>
<BR>
CWCVS also requires that you install a version of MacCVS on your machine.
MacCVS is a public domain implementation of a CVS client that is based on
the GNU implementation of CVS. We use the <A HREF="http://www.strata.com/">Strata</A>
version 3.1 of MacCVS which can be <A HREF="http://www.digapp.com/maccvs/">downloaded</A>
from the web. This version supports resource forks, an improved AppleEvent
suite and project files.<BR>
<BR>
The current CodeWarrior VCS architecture does not support creation of databases,
therefore you must either use existing CVS repositories or know how to create
new CVS repositories on the server. Moreover, CWCVS does not have a <TT>cvs
checkout</TT> facility, so you must use the MacCVS application to create
one from an existing repository.</P>

<H3>Client Interface.</H3>

<P>For those who wish to &quot;roll their own&quot; MacCVS from the public
domain source, CWCVS requires a local copy of an application with the creator
code specified in the CWCVS Options preferences panel that implements the
DoScript AppleEvent {'misc', 'dosc'} with the following parameters:<BR>
<BR>
<SAMP>Do Command: Execute a CVS command<BR>
Do Command list -- Command line arguments, one per list item<BR>
[Mode AE/File] -- Mode (AE, File).<BR>
[Environment list] -- Environment variables.<BR>
[Filename string] -- Output file path.<BR>
[Pathway string] -- Starting pathway.<BR>
[NoLineBuffer boolean] -- if true, send each result line as separate AE.<BR>
</SAMP><BR>
Note that this is slightly different from the original event defined by
Mike Ladwig in that the arguments are no longer parsed from the list strings,
but copied directly. The keyword definitions are:</P>

<MENU>
  <P><SAMP>Mode 'MODE'</SAMP>
  <MENU>
    <P><SAMP>AE 'TOAE'<BR>
    File 'FILE'</SAMP>
  </MENU>
  <P><SAMP>Environment 'ENVT'<BR>
  Filename 'FILE'<BR>
  Pathway 'SPWD'<BR>
  <BR>
  NoLineBuffer 'LBUF'</SAMP>
</MENU>

<P>The environment variables are specified as pairs of adjacent entries
in a list, namely &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt;...
.</P>

<P>CWCVS also assumes that</P>

<UL>
  <LI>the local workspace looks like a GNU CVS workspace (e.g. <TT>CVS/Entries</TT>
  etc. are defined);
  <LI>the results of commands conforms substantially to the GNU <TT>stdout</TT>/<TT>stderr</TT>
  results;
  <LI>the <TT>.CVSPASS</TT> file is kept in the Preferences folder;
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="installation"></A>Installation.</H2>

<P>Simply copy the CWCVS folder into the CodeWarrior Plugins folder in your
CodeWarrior hierarchy. CodeWarrior should not be running when you do this.<BR>
<BR>
If you do not have a copy of CWCVS, you can <A HREF="http://www.electricfish.com/products/CWCVS/Download.html">download</A>
it from our web site. There is also a <A HREF="http://www.electricfish.com/hawkfish/CWCVS/FAQ.html">FAQ</A>
if you have questions that are not covered by this manual, and some <A 
HREF="ReleaseNotes.html">release notes</A> describing the version change
history.<BR>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2><A NAME="preparation"></A>Preparation.</H2>

<P><BR>
Before using CWCVS with a project, you must first have a CVS repository
that is available to you via TCP. <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/doc-cederqvist.html">Documentation</A>
on how to do this can be found in many places, but the best place to start
is probably the <A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_toc.html">Cederqvist
manual</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Next, you need to have a project folder created by the <TT>cvs checkout</TT>
command. We strongly recommend that you do the initial checkout with the
version of MacCVS that you will use with the plugin. We have found that
different versions of MacCVS have slightly different file formats which
are mutually incompatible.<BR>
<BR>
If you are using the recommended version of MacCVS, you can check in project
files by using the .mcp extension, so you may wish to rename your project
files. Also, if you have MacCVS configured to use Internet Config for extension
mapping, make sure that all the extensions in your project have the correct
mappings.</P>

<H2><A NAME="configuration"></A>Configuration.</H2>

<P><BR>
To configure a project for use with CWCVS, do the following:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Determine the setting of the $CVSROOT environment variable for the
  CVS repository that you wish to use;
  <LI>Open the project file for which you wish to use CWCVS for source control;
  <LI>Choose Version Control Settings... from the Edit menu;
  <LI>Select the&quot;VCS Setup&quot; panel;
  <LI>Make sure that &quot;Use version Control&quot; is checked;
  <LI>Choose &quot;CWCVS&quot; from the popup menu;
  <LI>Enter your CVS username (e.g. &quot;hawkfish&quot;) in the &quot;Username&quot;
  field (this becomes the $<CODE>LOGNAME</CODE> and <CODE>$USER</CODE> environment
  variables);
  <LI>Enter your CVS password (this is the <CODE>pserver</CODE> password);
  <LI>Use the &quot;Local Root&quot; control to choose the CVS checkout folder;
  <LI>Use the &quot;Database Path&quot; control to choose any folder: as
  CVS does not use a file system database, we suggest choosing the &quot;Local
  Root&quot; folder, but you must choose a folder or the IDE will not enable
  source control;
  <LI>Set the other options as desired (we recommend &quot;Connect on open&quot;,
  &quot;Remember password&quot; and&quot;Try to mount shared volume&quot;
  to minimize startup interaction);
  <LI>Click &quot;Save&quot;.
</OL>

<P>At this point, you should configure the VCS Environment Prefs panel.
To do this, do the following:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Select the &quot;VCS Environment&quot; panel;
  <LI>Click on the list entry containing the line <CODE>&quot;</CODE>CVSROOT=...<CODE>&quot;;</CODE>
  <LI>Edit the value of the <CODE>CVSROOT</CODE> environment variable;
  <LI>Click &quot;Add&quot;;
  <LI>Enter any other environment variables by entering the name and the
  value and clicking &quot;Add&quot;. Note that tab does <I>not</I> work
  between the fields (this is an IDE bug);
  <LI>Click &quot;Save&quot;.
</OL>

<P>If you are an experienced CVS user, you may wish to configure the default
options for each command. To do this, do the following:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Open the CWCVS Options preferences panel;
  <LI>Enter the desired options;
  <LI>Click &quot;Save&quot;;
</OL>

<H4>Important Note:</H4>

<P>CVS maintains the &quot;Local Root&quot; directory specified above. It
is good practice to consider this directory as owned by CVS.<BR>

<H2><A NAME="vcsBasics"></A>Version Control Basics.</H2>

<H3>Introduction.</H3>

<P>This section is intended as a quick introduction to version control for
the novice. We will take as a model an abstract programming project that
may have one or more developers working on it and go through the entire
process from start to finish. Note that this is not intended to be a comprehensive
discussion of version control, nor is it our intention to imply that the
CodeWarrior VCS model or GNU CVS are the last word in version control. For
a list of all version control systems available for the Macintosh, as well
as pointers to other online resources about version control and configuration
management, please see our <A HREF="http://www.electricfish.com/hawkfish/macvcs/">Macintosh
VCS Page</A> on the net.</P>

<H3>The CodeWarrior interface.</H3>

<P>Before we begin, a word about CodeWarrior. The CodeWarrior IDE has a
plugin interface for Version Control Systems (VCSs) that is accessed through
the VCS menu. This menu is an icon that looks like three stacked documents
and appears when you have selected a VCS system to use from the Version
Control Settings. The menu has two submenus, Project and Recursive, and
you can bring up Advanced option dialogs for most commands by holding down
the option key. Recursive commands apply to all the files under version
control (or some obvious subset of them) and may have Advanced dialogs.</P>

<H3>Getting started.</H3>

<P>Version control allows you to track different versions (or snapshots,
if you will) of the files used to make a program (or anything for that matter,
but we will stick to programming). While it is often used to keep track
of the work of several developers, it can also be used quite beneficially
by a single developer working alone. CWCVS itself has one developer, but
uses version control to keep the older versions of its source files, resource
files, project files and documentation organized and backed up. This manual
itself is one of the files kept under version control.</P>

<P>The most important thing that version control does is to specify a database
for storing all the versions of all the files in the project that is separate
from the versions being worked on by a developer. This database, in addition
to organizing all the revisions of all the files, also serves as a backup
for the project. The first thing you do (as described in the previous <A
HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#configuration">configuration</A>
section) is specify a location for the database. If the database you specify
does not exist, CWCVS will not allow you to connect. See the CVS <A HREF=
"http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/doc-cederqvist.html">documentation</A> for information
on how to set up a repository.</P>

<H3>Creating and editing files.</H3>

<P>So that now you have a database, how do you add files to it? After you
have added a new file to the project itself and are ready to preserve a
version of it, you add a new file to the database with the <A HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#addCommand">Add</A>
command in the VCS menu. CVS will then schedule the file to be added to
the database. You commit the new file to the database with the <A HREF=
"../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#checkinCommand">Checkin</A>
command. After committing the change, CWCVS locks the file so that you won't
accidentally make changes to it.</P>

<P>Later on, you may need to make further changes to a file, say to add
a feature or fix a bug. To unlock a file, you use the <A HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#checkoutCommand">Checkout</A>
VCS command. The file will then be unlocked and you can start working on
it. This is the part of the process that annoys many new users of version
control. Try to remember that what you gain from tracking your changes and
being deliberate about them generally outweighs the slight inconvenience
of the checkout process.</P>

<P>Now, the bug is fixed and you want to save your changes in the database.
You do this with the <A HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#checkinCommand">Checkin</A>
VCS command. You will be prompted for a comment describing what you did
to the file. After checking in the file, the version in your workspace is
locked again to prevent you from making accidental changes to it.</P>

<P>Occasionally, you will start to make changes and realize that you have
been making them to the wrong file. If you check out a file in error, just
use the <A HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#undoCheckoutCommand">Undo
Checkout</A> command to back out your changes and get a fresh copy from
the database.</P>

<P>If you are working with a group, or if you have several machines where
you work on your project, you may occasionally need to get individual files
or even the entire source tree from the repository. You do this with the
<A HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#getCommand">Get</A>
and <A HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#getCommand">Recursive
Get</A> commands. These will make sure that you have the latest versions
of all your files. You can even get older versions of a file by holding
down the option key and using the Advanced Get dialog.</P>

<H3>Getting information.</H3>

<P>One of the strengths of version control is that it enables you to track
down changes by asking the database questions. CVS (on which CWCVS is based)
allows you to ask it what files and revisions (snapshots) have certain properties.
You make these queries with the <A HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#historyCommand">History</A>
and <A HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#statusCommand">Status</A>
commands. Another useful type of query is to compare the contents of a file
that you have in your workspace with a version in the database, which is
done with the <A HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#differenceCommand">Difference</A>
command. Finally, there is global information for the entire database (when
it was created, etc.) and this is available from the <A HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#variablesCommand">Variables</A>
command.</P>

<H3>File management.</H3>

<P>Over the course of a project, files are created and added, but they are
sometimes renamed, removed or even exported to another project. The VCS
<A HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#renameCommand">Rename</A>
command allows you to rename a file (although the IDE must be told to use
the file with the new name). While CWCVS implements this operation for you,
CVS has no rename operation, so a new file is created and the original history
is part of the old file, which is deleted. The VCS <A HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#deleteCommand">Delete</A>
command doesn't actually delete the file, but it makes it so that it will
not be used in the project any more (you can undelete it in MacCVS, but
the CodeWarrior IDE does not have an interface for this operation).</P>

<P>Files are usually organized in a directory hierarchy, and CWCVS allows
you to create a matching hierarchical database as you add directories. To
do this, simply add a new file from the directory to the database. Be warned
that the directory on the server may be created with odd access permissions
that may have to be sorted out before other users can view these directories.</P>

<H3>Revision groups.</H3>

<P>It's now time for the first beta to be released. When you do this, you
may want to take a snapshot of the entire database. The <A HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#labelCommand">Recursive
Label</A> VCS command allows you to create a symbolic name (or label) for
this snapshot. This snapshot can be retrieved later with the <A HREF="../../../CWProjector/Source/CWProjector.html#getCommand">Recursive
Get</A> command by holding down the option key and typing in the label name.</P>

<H3>Miscellaneous topics.</H3>

<P>While all the operations described above are quite simple, requiring
at most a comment string or a label, there are sometimes other options that
you might want to specify, such as updating administrative information etc..
Holding down the option key while choosing a command will bring up a dialog
box allowing you to specify such options. Some of the options are obvious;
others (such as branching) are beyond the scope of this discussion. See
the CVS documentation for more information.</P>

<P>The IDE allows you to perform VCS operations on the project file itself
from the Project submenu. This is a good practice to get into as it make
sure that all the information needed to rebuild your program is stored in
the database, not just the source files.</P>

<P>CVS stands for &quot;Concurrent Versions System&quot; which means that
several developers can be working on a file simultaneously. CVS merges changes
together when you check a file in, and notifies you of any conflicts. This
is usually not a problem, but it is quite different from most version control
systems. Of course, this doesn't work very well for binary files, but for
text it is extremely convenient.</P>

<P>* CWCVS supports advanced (dialog) versions of these commands. <BR>
<BR>
All cvs commands use the directory of the file being manipulated as the
cwd, or the local root directory for Recursive commands.</P>

<H4>Kerberos.</H4>

<P>CWCVS attempts to make life pleasant for Kerberos users. Before each
command, $CVSROOT is checked to see if the &quot;:kserver:&quot; string
is present. If it is and if there is no valid ticket in the cache, the login
dialog is put up. Users who use Kerberos without the :kserver: option must
login separately.<BR>
<BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#contents">Contents</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="getCommand"></A>Get.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Get</I> command retrieves the current version of the file. The recursive
version updates all files in the project folder to their current versions.
All files are locked by default (including the project file).</P>

<P>Advanced dialogs are also available for both versions of the Get command.
These dialogs allow you fairly complete access to all the various update
options provided by CVS. These options are in two groups. The first group
is used to make changes to the sticky tags associated with the file (or
with the entire project). As part of the Get, you can change the default
keyword expansion and update all the sticky tags associated with the file(s)
begin gotten. The option you are mot likely to use here is &quot;Reset sticky
tags&quot; to update how a file is treated (e.g. a file has been marked
as binary and you need to copy that setting to your local workspace.)</P>

<P>The second group is used to specify which versions of the file and/or
directories are retrieved. The first two checkboxes allow you to specify
how any new or deleted directories in the repository are dealt with; the
Revision popup allows to specify which date or revision you wish to update
to; the last text fields allow you to merge branches of the source tree
into the workspace. The most common options you would use here are the directory
update options and specifying a particular revision to retrieve.</P>

<P>The cvs update command is quite complex and we recommend that you read
the cvs documentation before attempting to do anything sophisticated.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS commands are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs -r update [-k&lt;keyword&gt;] [-A] [-P] [-d] [(-r &lt;revision&gt; | -D &lt;date&gt;) [-f]] [-j&lt;tag1&gt; [-j&lt;tag2&gt;]] &lt;file&gt;</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="checkoutCommand"></A>Checkout.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Checkout</I> command makes a file available for writing. This consists
of notifying cvs that you are about to edit the file.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>Note that &quot;Checkout&quot; is the IDE's term for retrieving a file
with write permission. This is completely unrelated to the <TT>cvs checkout</TT>
command.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs -w edit &lt;file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="checkinCommand"></A>Checkin.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Checkin</I> command commits the current version of a file to the
repository and locks it. The recursive version commits all locally modified
files. You will be prompted for a comment that describes what you are did
to the file(s). After checkin, the file(s) will be locked (including the
project file).</P>

<P>Advanced dialogs are also available for both forms of the command. the
dialogs allow you to specify the branch or revision to commit to, and to
turn off module processing for the checkin.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS commands are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs -r commit [-r &lt;revision&gt;] [-n] -m &lt;comment&gt; &lt;file&gt;</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="undoCheckoutCommand"></A>Undo Checkout.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Undo checkout</I> command cancels the checkout of the file. It does
this by cancelling the edit notification from the <A HREF="#checkoutCommand">Checkout</A>,
deleting the file and getting a fresh copy.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS commands used are:</P>

<H3><A NAME="historyCommand"></A>History.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>History</I> command displays a change history of the file obtained
from CVS. If you select multiple files, each one will appear in its own
window with a &quot;.history&quot; suffix. The recursive version returns
the history information for all files in the module.</P>

<P>The advanced dialog for the History command allows you to prune down
the revisions and text displayed. Consult the CVS documentation for more
information.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

If you select multiple files, each one will appear in its own window with
a &quot;.watchers&quot; or &quot;.editors&quot; suffix. The recursive version
of the command displays watchers or editors for the entire project.</P>

<P>The advanced version of this command is used to toggle between displaying
the watchers and editors. Hold down the command key to display the editors.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS commands used are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs watchers &lt;filename&gt;
cvs editors &lt;filename&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the regular versions and:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs watchers
cvs editors</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the recursive versions.</P>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="differenceCommand"></A>Difference.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Difference</I> command allows you to compare a file to the repository
version. If you select multiple files, each one will appear in its own window
with a &quot;.diff&quot; suffix.</P>

<P>The regular version compares the workspace version to the revision it
was derived from. The advanced version of the command allows you to specify
which revisions of the file to compare, how to expand RCS keywords and various
diff options. The recursive version will show the differences for every
text file that has been modified. The advanced recursive version will show
all differences between any sets of files in just about any manner you could
want.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS commands used are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs diff [-k&lt;keyword option&gt;] [-r &lt;tag1&gt; | -D &lt;date1&gt; [-r &lt;tag2&gt; | -D &lt;date2&gt;]] [-c] &lt;file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the regular version and:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs diff [-k&lt;keyword option&gt;] [-r &lt;tag1&gt; | -D &lt;date1&gt; [-r &lt;tag2&gt; | -D &lt;date2&gt;]] [-c]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the recursive version. Only the <TT>-c</TT> options is specified
by default.</P>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="labelCommand"></A>Label.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Label</I> command allows you to label the state of a module so that
you can refer to it later. The command will prompt you for a label to use
for the module. You can later use the Recursive <A HREF="#getCommand">Get</A>
command to retrieve this set of source and work with it.</P>

<P>CVS actually has two label commands: one labels the revisions currently
in your workspace; the other labels the revisions currently in the repository.
The regular Label command works with the revisions in the workspace and
the advanced Label command (hold down the option key) works with the revisions
in the repository.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS commands used are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs tag [-F] [-b] [-c] [-d] &lt;tag&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the regular command and:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs rtag [-F] [-a] [-c] [-d] [-R &lt;rev&gt; | -D &lt;date&gt;] [-f] &lt;tag&gt; &lt;local root name&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the recursive version. Only the <TT>-F</TT> option is specified by
default.</P>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="renameCommand"></A>Rename.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Rename</I> command changes a file's name in the repository. It does
this in the recommended manner, namely by renaming the file locally, deleting
the old file and adding the new file. After the rename, the file is labeled
as checked out and can now be checked in. The IDE does not know that the
file has been renamed, so you must add the new version manually before doing
the checkin.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS/POSIX commands used are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>mv &lt;old name&gt;  &lt;new name&gt;
cvs remove &lt;old name&gt;
cvs add &lt;new name&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="addCommand"></A>Add.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Add</I> command adds a new file to the local repository. It does
not commit it. After the add command, the file is labeled as checked out
and can now be checked in. By default, non-text files are checked in as
binary files. By holding down the option key, you can specify a file description
and a keyword option for the file.</P>

<P>Before adding a file, the Add command checks to make sure that the directories
below the local root that contain the file are in the repository. If not,
it will prompt you (from the top down) to add the directory.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs add [-k&lt;keyword&gt; [-m &lt;description&gt;] &lt;file name&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The <TT>-kb</TT> option is specified by default for non-text files. When
adding a directory, the CVS command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs add &lt;directory name&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>with the cwd set to the directory's parent. The test to determine whether
the directory exists is simply to check for the <TT>CVS</TT> directory.</P>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="deleteCommand"></A>Delete.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Delete</I> command schedules a file to be deleted from the repository.
It does not commit the deletion. <BR>
<BR>
Unlike CVS, the IDE expects the file to only be deleted from the repository
but not from the local drive, which means that once the file has been deleted,
the only way to commit the deletion is to use the <A HREF="#checkinCommand">Recursive
Checkin</A> command.<BR>
<BR>
After committing, the file is still in the repository attic, but the IDE
has no interface for recovering it.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs remove &lt;file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="connectCommand"></A>Connect.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Connect</I> command makes sure that MacCVS is available and fails
if it is not. If you are using a pserver connection method, CWCVS will attempt
to log you in with the password specified. If your password is not valid,
you will not be allowed to connect.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>If the connection method is <TT>pserver</TT> then a <TT>cvs login</TT>
is faked by adding the password to the <TT>.cvspass</TT> file and then attempting
to issue a</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs -n -q update</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>command. If this fails, the <TT>.cvspass</TT> file is restored and the
connection fails.</P>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="disconnectCommand"></A>Disconnect.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Disconnect</I> command is currently a nop.<BR>
<BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="aboutCommand"></A>About.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>About</I> command displays a dialog box with version information.<BR>
<BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="variablesCommand"></A>Variables.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Variables</I> command displays information about the project, including
the status of all the files.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs status</PRE>
