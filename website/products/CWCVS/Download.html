<P>The alpha designation mostly means that the feature set is incomplete
and the beta designation means that we consider the product feature complete
but there may be a few small glitches left that we missed. CWCVS is used
for its own development, so hopefully bugs should be minimal at all times.
We always welcome <A HREF="mailto:hawkfish@electricfish.com?subject%3DCWCVS%20Feedback">feedback</A>
and suggestions. </P>
