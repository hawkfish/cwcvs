Does CWProjector support subprojects?<BR><BR>A. Yes. The original version of the <A HREF="CWProjector.html">manual</A>contained language in the <A HREF="CWProjector.html#preparation">Preparation</A>section that made it seem that only one top-level project was supported.In fact, the checkout directory hierarchy is mapped to the project hierarchyvia directory naming. Moreover, the top level directory name does not needto match the database name (the other ones must match, however).<BR><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.</P><H3>&nbsp;</H3><P><A NAME="Features_mw_sourceserver"></A>Q. Is CWProjector the same asMW SourceServer?<BR><BR>A. No! MW SourceServer is another SourceServer interface tool supplied byMetrowerks. CWProjector has several features not found in MW SourceServer:</P><UL>  <LI>Support for branches;  <LI>Implementation of the DTS Goodies header format;  <LI>Automatic project and sub-project creation;  <LI>Finder coloring;  <LI>Support for the Rename and Delete file management commands;  <LI>Support for the Comment and Variables commands;  <LI>Support for the Purge export command;  <LI>Support for the Difference command;  <LI>More extensive support for Recursive commands;</UL><P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.</P><H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="installation"></A>Installation</H3><P><A NAME="installation_SourceServer"></A>Q. Where is SourceServer?<BR><BR>A. SourceServer is on your CodeWarrior Tools disk. If the disk is in thedrive, you can <A HREF="/CWPro%202%20Tools/Apple%20Development%20Tools/SourceServer%203.4.1.sit">UnStuffit</A> into your Downloads folder. All you need to do is move it to a betterlocation on a local drive.<BR><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <BR><BR><BR><A NAME="installation_ToolServer"></A>Q. Why do I need to install ToolServer?<BR><BR>A. You don't. The ToolServer/SourceServer documentation on the CodeWarriordisks is intended for users who want to use SourceServer from the IDE'sToolServer menu - a far less elegant solution than CWProjector. With CWProjector,all you need is the SourceServer application.<BR><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.</P><H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="configuration"></A>Configuration</H3><P><A NAME="configuration_automation"></A>Q. How can I automate the configurationprocess?<BR><BR>A. The VCS Setup and VCSComment Prefs panels are AppleScriptable, but theIDE is not recordable, so you will need to issue some Get Preferences todetermine exatly what your settings are. <BR><BR>The following AppleScript is what we use to configure the CWProjector project:<BR><BR><B><CODE>tell</CODE></B><CODE> application &quot;CodeWarrior IDE 2.1&quot;</CODE></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><CODE>Set Preferences of panel &quot;VCSComment Pref&quot; to {FinderLabels:true,  CheckedInLabel:2, CheckedOutLabel:6, ModifyReadOnlyLabel:4, OrphanedLabel:0,  PromptMode:always, UserInitials:&quot;rmgw&quot;, CopyrightNotice:&quot;Copyright  &copy;1997-8 Electric Fish Inc.

How do I configure CWProjector towork off-line?<BR><BR>A. CWProjector can be used off-line in two ways. <BR><BR>The first (and recommended way) is to uncheck the &quot;Connect on open&quot;and &quot;Try to mount shared volume&quot; checkboxes before you disconnectthe machine from the network or drive where the Projector database is kept.When you open the project next, you should see that the Connect menu itemis enabled and very little else. At this point, you can work on files bychoosing &quot;Make Writeable&quot; from the VCS popup in the file window(or by trying to edit the file and choosing it in the alert.) When you reconnectto the database, you can check in your changes by holding down the cmd-keyand choosing &quot;Checkin&quot;. After entering a comment, the file willbe checked in again. Be warned that advanced options are not available here(this is an IDE limitation).<BR><BR>The other way is to create a fake local database and connect to it whileyou are working off-line. The only real advantage of this technique is thatit allows you to use the Comment command to add header comments. Beyondthan that, it is likely to be confusing because the VCS menu is enabled,but using any of the other commands could cause unpredictable results.<BR><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <BR><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H2><A NAME="commands"></A>Commands<BR></H2><P><A NAME="commands_missing_project"></A>Q. Why can't the project be foundfor a file?<BR><BR>A. CWProjector uses the 'ckid' resource in a file to determine which projectit belongs to. If the file belongs to a subproject and was checked out whilethat subproject was mounted by itself, the 'ckid' may not refer to the mainproject. You will generally get an error of the form<BR></P><PRE>  The project could not be found.  ### MountProject - Unable to get information on &quot;SubProjectName&quot;.  # File not found (OS error -43)</PRE><P>You can check for this by looking at the project name in the 'ckid' resource.If the full project path (as you specified it in the VCS Setup panel) isnot there then you have a problem.<BR><BR>The simplest solution is just tot throw out the files and do a RecursiveGet. If some of the files are checked out, you should check them in withMPW before throwing them out.<BR><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <BR></P><H4><A NAME="commands_add"></A>Add</H4><P><BR><A NAME="commands_add_mountproblem"></A>Q. Why can't I add a file to a newsubproject?<BR><BR>A. CWProjector uses SourceServer to mount projects. When it mounts a project,SourceServer makes a note of all the subprojects. If you then go into MPWand create a new subproject, SourceServer does not know about it and anerror results when you try and add a file to this subproject.<BR><BR>The solution is to manually quit SourceServer and do a Disconnect/Connectsequence inside CodeWarrior. This will remount the main project and eveythingshould be fine now.<BR><BR>Under CWProjector 2.0, this is no longer a problem as it create subprojectson the fly.<BR><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.</P><H4><A NAME="commands_connect"></A>Connect</H4><P><BR><BR><A NAME="commands_connect_nouser"></A>Q. Why does SourceServer tell me Ihave no user ID?<BR><BR>A. SourceServer appears to require that you enter a value in the SharingSetup control panel. Quit SourceServer, open the panel, and enter a newuser ID. This should solve the problem.<BR><BR>This usually happens when you do a clean system install and forget to setup File Sharing. <BR><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <BR><BR><BR><A NAME="commands_connect_duplicateID"></A>Q. Why does SourceServer tellme I have a duplicate project databaseID?<BR><BR>A. If you copy a database in the Finder and attempt to open both it andthe original at the same time you will get this error. The error means thatyou cannot work on both databases at the same time. The solution is to quitSourceServer and choose a database to work with.<BR><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.</P><H4><BR><A NAME="commands_checkin"></A>CheckIn</H4><P><BR><A NAME="commands_checkin_mro"></A>Q. How do I check in an MRO'ed file?<BR><BR>A. The CodeWarrior IDE will enable all VCS menu commands if you hold downthe command key. You can then choose &quot;Checkin&quot; to check the filein. Unfortunately, the IDE does not allow the use of advanced command dialogsin this case, so make sure that a normal checkin is what you want.<BR><BR>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<BR><BR></P><H4><A NAME="commands_checkout"></A>CheckOut</H4><P><BR><A NAME="commands_checkout_idewindowstate"></A>Q. Why is the IDE windowstate incorrect?<BR><BR>A. IDE versions through 3.3b1 appear to have a bug displaying the new documentedadvanced states defined by the VCS API but only in the text window of thefile. The state is reported correctly in the rest of the IDE. If this iscausingyou problems, just close the file and reopen it. Metrowerks is aware ofthe problem.</P><P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.<BR><BR><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><ADDRESS>This page was last updated on 1 December 1998 by <A HREF="mailto:hawkfish@electricfish.com?subject%3DCWProjector%20Download%20Page">RichardWesley</A>.</ADDRESS><ADDRESS>Copyright&copy; 1997-8 by Electric Fish ,Inc.
