<H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="3_2"></A>3.2</H3>

<P>In this build I have been making some internal reorganization of the
code to support a Contextual Menu plugin I am writing. There should be no
impact on the CW plugin itself.</P>

<P>When 3.1 came out I forgot to enable Difference for old versions of the
IDE. This has been fixed and <TT>TEXT</TT> differences are now rerouted
to a BBEdit helper applet (this will also be the default for the CMM module.)</P>

<P>I have mucked around a bit with the mounting code to make sure that projects
are always mounted, but with a minimum of time hit. I've been tesing this
over a slow AppleShare IP connection and it seems to be both tolerable and
robust now.</P>

<P>There are serious linkage errors in the Metrowerks 68K callback libraries
which means that the 68K code has not worked for some time now. The only
solution I have been able to come up with is to make the 68K code into a
Code Fragment and link against PluginLib4. This should work with IDE 3.0
and later.</P>

<P>Versions numbering is now being done in a more rational way: Major revisions
indicate file format changes (in our case, operions settings); Minor revisions
indicate new features; Fix revisions are only bug fixes. This revision has
both bug fixes and new features so it is 3.2.</P>

<H4>Change history:</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Remap Difference to BBEdit if IDE too old;
  <LI>Fix an obscure problem where subprojects would not get remounted automatically;
  <LI>Preserve mod date across header comment changes;
  <LI>Respond to MRO notifications with comment dialog and sanity checks;
  <LI>Provide status feedback during project lookup and mounting;
  <LI>Only mount top projects;
  <LI>Fix problem with matching open/close header comments;
  <LI>Change 68K build to be a code fragment;
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.</P>

<H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="3_1_1"></A>3.1.1</H3>

<H4>Change history:</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Fix top-level pathnames;
  <LI>Add <TT>.exp</TT> header comment;
  <LI>Improve non-<TT>TEXT</TT> Difference error message;
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.</P>

<H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="3_1"></A>3.1</H3>

<H4>Change history:</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Add <TT>.prefix</TT> header comment;
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.</P>

<H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="3_1b1"></A>3.1b1</H3>

<P>Escaped strings coming back from SourceServer were being parsed in an
<I>ad hoc</I> manner. This has been fixed, and file revisions like &quot;what's
new,12&quot; (which are returned as 'what'&lt;opt-d&gt;'' new,12') are now
unmunged correctly in the dialogs.</P>

<P>I have taken advantage of the compare suite in <A HREF="http://www.mathemaesthetics.com/ResorcererInfo.html">Resourcerer</A>
version 2.2 to implement helper applications in the Difference command.
The <TT>CTM#</TT> resource number 16260 has the mappings from file types
to helper applications, and if you want to redirect specific file types
to a specific helper applications, feel free to edit this resource. The
application must support the Resourcerer compare suite; if not, you may
have to write a small applet.</P>

<H4>Change history:</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Fix escaped string parsing;
  <LI>Preserve modification date when changing 'ckid' (Comment etc.);
  <LI>Detect SourceServer return buffer overflows and report them;
  <LI>Implement helper applications for Differences using Resourcerer's compare
  suite;
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.</P>

<H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="3_0"></A>3.0</H3>

<P>We are now web-savvy! The registration dialog has a link to the Kagi
registration page and the about box has a link to the online download page.</P>

<H4>Change history:</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Add timeout and countdown to registration dialog;
  <LI>Add URL links to Registration and About dialogs;
  <LI>Hack around IDE editor window status bug;
  <LI>Display full pathnames in Status;
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.</P>

<H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="3_0b2"></A>3.0b2</H3>

<P>I got tired of having to go to the Recursive Get command to find out
what labels were defined, so now the Regular (non-dialog) Recursive Label
command lists all the labels for the project. If NameRevisions had a simple
way to make a file-by-file query, I'd put that in too, but so far no luck.
This means that to label a build you must now hold down the option key when
choosing Recursive Label. I know that this is changing a behavior, but the
new behavior is read-only so I am willing to live with it.</P>

<H4>Change history:</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Fix preferences panels' Flag resource data versions;
  <LI>Add Recursive Label command;
  <LI>Remove temporary file dependency in Difference;
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.</P>

<H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="3_0b1"></A>3.0b1</H3>

<P>An intermittent problem involving resource fork opening and closing has
been resolved. The symptoms involved erratic default behavior of commands
and garbage initialization for the corresponding dialogs.</P>

<H4>Change history:</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Fix resource fork preservation issue;
  <LI>Fix quoted labels;
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.</P>

<H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="3_0a4"></A>3.0a4</H3>

<P>With this release we are once again backwards compatible to IDE version
1.7.4 (and even Lite 3.0!), with two small caveats. The first is that Difference
is only available for IDE 3.0 and later and the second is that it is only
available before IDE 3.2 if the enclosed PluginLib4 library is placed next
to the IDE.</P>

<P>Checkin revision names are now supported in the Checkin command and Header
Comments also tracks the new revision specifications.</P>

<H4>Change history:</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Work with all VCS enabled IDEs.
  <LI>Disable Difference when not available from IDE;
  <LI>Add checkin revision specification;
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.</P>

<H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="3_0a3"></A>3.0a3</H3>

<P>The big change for this release is the new CWProjector Options preferences
panel. This will allow you to configure the default settings for each command.
The defaults are the options used for the regular versions of the commands
for the initial state of the Advanced command dialogs. Some of these options
are dangerous (e.g. the branch settings) so only mess with them if you know
what you are doing.</P>

<P>I forgot about the files only (no projects) and short listing options
for ProjectInfo so they are now there for completeness. Note that using
short listing for history is legal, but pointless. Files only is ignored
by SourceServer for recursive operations, so I have left it out of the recursive
dialog.</P>

<H4>Change history:</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Add short and files only options to ProjectInfo dialogs;
  <LI>Implement default options preferences, replacing hardwired defaults;
  <LI>Restore scrap after checkin comment dialog;
  <LI>Clean up GUI (grayscale group boxes, font height adjustments);
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>.</P>

<H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="3_0a2"></A>3.0a2</H3>

<P>Headers used to be detected by an almost exact match to the CWProjector
header. Now we just try to find a header that looks like the Comm 16001
resource. The current Comm 16001 resource just contains the comment start
line and the change history line.</P>

<P>The Properties and History commands are now fully functional, with dialogs
for specifying all file-related options to the ProjectInfo command and an
option in the Advanced command for sticking the result into a single window.
Status now has this last option as well.</P>

<P>The Label command used to label only the latest revision of a file that
had been checked in. The new version will allow you to label the actual
revisions that you have on disk. You may now also replace an existing label
and specify that the label be dynamic (i.e. track the latest revision).</P>

<P>My partner wore me down and I have implemented Recursive Checkout. This
is not the same as Projector's CheckOut -r because we have to insert header
comments in all the files, so a tree walk is done instead.</P>

<H4>Change history:</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Simplify header detection;
  <LI>Implement full Properties and History commands;
  <LI>Add Advanced Status dialog;
  <LI>Fix memory overwrite error in Advanced Comment (Task);
  <LI>Expand Label functionality;
  <LI>Implement Recursive Checkout;
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="3_0a1"></A>3.0a1</H3>

<P><BR>
The Purge command (both regular and recursive) is now mapped to OrphanFiles.
This is extremely useful for doing import/export operations. To aid in import
operations, the Add command now detects the existence of a file header and
give the option to reuse it. The Get command now works on individual files
even if the file is missing or orphaned (no 'ckid' resource).</P>

<P>Support for Task Names is much improved. When adding and checking out,
task names are reused in the dialogs, making it easy to do several checkouts/adds
for the same task. When checking in, the default task name is the one in
the ckid resource. The Comment command now has an advanced version that
changes the task name of the file.</P>

<P>One of the invisible changes involves converting the command handlers
to C++. The base class implements generic recursion, which made it quite
easy to implement recursive versions of most of the commands. There are
now recursive versions of the Undo Checkout, Checkin, Difference and Comment
commands which act as if you had selected all checked out/MRO files in the
IDE and issued the command. I also mapped Advanced Recursive Status to displaying
only the files that are checked out or MRO - a simple way to determine what
files you have modified.</P>

<H4><BR>
Change history:</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Fix Recursive Get to use options specified in dialog;
  <LI>Enable Get for orphaned/missing files;
  <LI>Add Purge commands;
  <LI>Use existing change headers in Add;
  <LI>Add Recursive Status command;
  <LI>Add Recursive Properties command;
  <LI>Add persistent task text in Advanced Add; and Advanced Checkout;
  <LI>Use CheckOut task as default for CheckIn;
  <LI>Add Task Name editing via Advanced Comment;
  <LI>Implement Difference commands.
  <LI>Expand recursion to include Undo Checkout, Checkin, Difference and
  Comment;
  <LI>Use Advanced Recursive Status command to display checked out/MRO files;
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="2_0_3"></A>2.0.3</H3>

<P><BR>
Recursive Get's menu of NameRevisions was not retrieving all revisions as
the -r option was not specified. The list is now complete and sorted.<BR>
<BR>
Change history:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Fix Recursive Get popup;
  <LI>Enable educational pricing in Register application;<BR>
  
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="2_0_2"></A>2.0.2</H3>

<P><BR>
Undo Checkout was not specifying the correct version of a file to cancel
checkout on unless the checkout was a new branch. Instead, it would always
cancel checkout on the main trunk, which could be very surprising for the
user who actually had that branch checked out! Unless you are part of a
large project where users are checking out main trunk code and branch files
simultaneously, you would not have been affected by this problem.<BR>
<BR>
There was also a small problem with the Finder Labels menus in the VCS Comments
panel. Due to some symmetries and a layout reversal, the only configuration
that would work correctly was the shipping one.<BR>
<BR>
Change history:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Use correct version in Undo Checkout.
  <LI>Fix Finder Label menus.
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="2_0_1"></A>2.0.1</H3>

<P>There were about five interacting bugs in the header comments code, all
triggered by modifications made recently to handle branches correctly. Four
of them were benign, ranging from silly to annoying, but one was capable
of causing serious problems. The silly bug was that some of the header comments
code was being used even when they were turned off, but it meant that the
serious bug could still cause crashes even when header comments were turned
off! This has all been fixed.<BR>
<BR>
Change history:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Fix crash/text garbage problems in header comments.
  <LI>Tidy up database creation messages.
  <LI>Fix VCS Comments panel factory preferences.
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="2_0"></A>2.0</H3>

<P>Change history:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>IDE look and feel for registration.
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="2_0b5"></A>2.0b5</H3>

<P><BR>
There have been several requests to allow the Finder Label feature to be
customized or turned off. The new VCSComments preferences panel v2.0b3 now
has a check box to disable the labels and four popup menus to choose the
labels. CWProjector now reads and honors those settings.<BR>
<BR>
Change history:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Add Finder Label disabling/customization.
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="2_0b4"></A>2.0b4</H3>

<P><BR>
Automated configuration is a common request. While the panel was in fact
scriptable, there was a bug in the script parsing which would truncate the
first character of the initials and copyright fields. The panel is now at
version 2.0b2.<BR>
<BR>
Change history:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Fix VCSComment preferences scripting text bug.
  <LI>Remove ckid Debugger break.
  <LI>Fix error message strings (screwed up during Comment command implementation).
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="2_0b3"></A>2.0b3</H3>

<P><BR>
The Status command is now the Properties command, and Status has been changed
to display the contents of the ckid resource for the file.<BR>
<BR>
The Checkout command now allows you to check out any version of a file.
The Undo Checkout command has been modified to handle this, as has the header
comments feature. Comments will now appear with the correct branch numbers.<BR>
<BR>
Change history:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Fix edit text backgrounds.
  <LI>Rename Status to Properties
  <LI>Implement new Status command.
  <LI>Add Checkout of any version.
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="2_0b2"></A>2.0b2</H3>

<P><BR>
Most of the feedback from 2.0b1 involved documentation clarifications.<BR>
<BR>
Change history:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Fix missing preferences panel crash.
  <LI>Implement Comment command.
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="2_0b1"></A>2.0b1</H3>

<P><BR>
Most of the changes in this release are cosmetic - making the dialogs match
the IDE and so forth.<BR>
<BR>
Change history:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Use ellipsis in IDE VCS menu for Label and Rename.
  <LI>Match IDE dialog appearance.
  <LI>Fix disabled check box manipulation.
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="2_0a2"></A>2.0a2</H3>

<P>The big feature in this release is the ability to create missing Projector
databases on the fly. In the past, databases and subdatabases had to be
created manually in MPW, which could lead to confusion as SourceServer would
not be aware of the new databases. Now, whenever a database is missing,
you will be asked whether you wish to create it. This includes the top-level
database, so all you need to do now is to create an empty folder where you
want the main database to be, before connecting for the first time.<BR>
<BR>
Change history:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Automate database and subdatabase creation.
</UL>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#index">Index</A>. <HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>
