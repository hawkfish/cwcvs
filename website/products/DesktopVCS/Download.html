<P>The alpha designation mostly means that the feature set is incomplete
and the beta designation means that we consider the product feature complete
but there may be a few small glitches left that we missed. Desktop VCS is
used for its own development, so hopefully bugs should be minimal at all
times. We always welcome <A HREF="mailto:hawkfish@electricfish.com?subject%3DDesktop%20VCS%20Feedback">feedback</A>
and suggestions.<BR>
