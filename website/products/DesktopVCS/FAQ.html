<A NAME="cmcvs_commands_checkout_why"></A>Q. This is CVS! Why do I have to check
out files?<BR>
<BR>
A. There are two reasons why you need to check out files: one CVS reason,
and one philosophical reason.</P>

<OL>
  <LI>The CVS reason for the Checkout command is that CVS does support exclusive
  locking via watched files and such files need to be reserved with a <TT>cvs
  edit</TT> command. Even if you don't use this feature, the module must
  support it.
  <LI>The Philosophical reason is that I personally feel that leaving files
  unlocked is a bad practice. If you are going to make a change to a file,
  you should be deliberate about it. Hopefully, the time you take to make
  that decision swamps the short time spent checking out the file. I think
  that the Concurrent part of CVS is really cool, but I also appreciate the
  virtue of not touching everything just because you can.
</OL>

<P>While I appreciate that not everyone agrees with #3, the reason that
it is not an option is because of #1. By making the module extremely baroque
I could probably make everyone happy, but the time and energy involved seems
like a waste. More time is saved by not having to switch to the client than
is wasted by the Checkout process.</P>
