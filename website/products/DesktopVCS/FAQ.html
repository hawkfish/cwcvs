<A NAME="cmcvs_requirements_maccvspro"></A>Q. Is MacCVS the same as MacCVS
Pro or MacCVS Client?<BR>
<BR>
A. No. The three are unrelated except for being CVS clients:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>MacCVS</B> is a CVS client based on the GNU source. This is the
  client used by CMCVS. It was written in stages by various individuals,
  <A HREF="http://www.strata.com/">Strata Corporation</A> and finally by
  <A HREF="http://www.wincvs.org/">WinCVS.org</A>. It can be <A HREF="http://wincvs.org/MacCvs312.sea.hqx">downloaded</A>
  from their web site.<BR>
  <LI><B>MacCVS Pro</B> is a CVS client written from scratch by the <A HREF=
  "http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</A> team for their source control. It
  is maintained by <A HREF="http://www.macvcs.org/">MacCVS.org</A>. CMCVS
  does not work with this client because it does not support the GNU command
  line interface.<BR>
  <LI><B>MacCVS Client</B> is a third CVS client written by <A HREF="mailto:joerg@fontworks.com">J&ouml;rg
  Bullman</A> at <A HREF="http://www.fontworks.com/">Fontworks</A>. It has
  its own <A HREF="http://www.glink.net.hk/~jb/MacCVSClient/">home page</A>
  if you are interested. CMCVS does not work with this client because it
  does not support the GNU command line interface.<BR>

<P><BR>
<A NAME="cmcvs_commands_checkout_why"></A>Q. This is CVS! Why do I have
to check out files?<BR>
<BR>
A. There are two reasons why you need to check out files: one CVS reason,
and one philosophical reason.</P>

<OL>
  <LI>The CVS reason for the Checkout command is that CVS does support exclusive
  locking via watched files and such files need to be reserved with a <TT>cvs
  edit</TT> command. Even if you don't use this feature, the module must
  support it.
  <LI>The Philosophical reason is that I personally feel that leaving files
  unlocked is a bad practice. If you are going to make a change to a file,
  you should be deliberate about it. Hopefully, the time you take to make
  that decision swamps the short time spent checking out the file. I think
  that the Concurrent part of CVS is really cool, but I also appreciate the
  virtue of not touching everything just because you can.
</OL>

<P>While I appreciate that not everyone agrees with #2, the reason that
it is not an option is because of #1. By making the module extremely baroque
I could probably make everyone happy, but the time and energy involved seems
like a waste. More time is saved by not having to switch to the client than
is wasted by the Checkout process.</P>
