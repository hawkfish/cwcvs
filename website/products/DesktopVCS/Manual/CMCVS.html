<P><BR>
CMCVS is a Contextual Menu Module which allows you to use <A HREF="http://www.wincvs.org/">WinCVS.org</A>'s
public domain <A HREF="http://www.wincvs.org/MacCvs312.sea.hqx">MacCVS</A>
CVS client for source control from the Finder desktop. <BR>
<BR>
CVS is a widely used POSIX-based source control system and CVS clients are
available on many platforms, including the Macintosh, making it a reasonable
choice for multiple platform development. CMCVS allows Macintosh developers
to use CVS from the Finder without arcane command line arguments or scripts.</P>

<P>CVS is not a simple system. We have attempted to make the interface in
CMCVS fairly easy to use and we have automated a couple of gotchas (directory
creation for example) but we strongly recommend reading the CVS <A HREF=
"http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/doc-cederqvist.html">documentation</A> before
getting in too deep.</P>

<P>If you are new to version control and determined to press on, you may
wish to start by reading the <A HREF="#vcsBasics">Version Control Basics</A>
section. Otherwise, keep reading.<BR>

<H2><A NAME="features"></A>Features.</H2>

<P>CMCVS provides access to the the standard functions of most source-code
control systems:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Get copies
  <LI>File management (Add, Rename, Delete)
  <LI>Check out/in
  <LI>Report generation
  <LI>Release management (Label)
</UL>

<P>CMCVS also provides integration with Finder's labeling sytem via the
VCSComments Pref panel.</P>

<H2><A NAME="requirements"></A>Requirements.</H2>

<P><BR>
CMCVS requires a version of the MacOS that supports Contextual Menus, Navigation
Services and the Appearance Manager .<BR>
<BR>
CMCVS also requires that you install a version of MacCVS on your machine.
MacCVS is a public domain implementation of a CVS client that is based on
the GNU implementation of CVS. We use the <A HREF="http://www.wincvs.org/">WinCVS.org</A>
version 3.1 of MacCVS which can be <A HREF="http://www.wincvs.org/MacCvs312.sea.hqx">downloaded</A>
from the web. This version supports resource forks, an improved AppleEvent
suite and project files.<BR>
<BR>
The current Desktop VCS architecture does not support creation of databases,
therefore you must either use existing CVS repositories or know how to create
new CVS repositories on the server. Moreover, CMCVS does not have a <TT>cvs
checkout</TT> facility, so you must use the MacCVS application to create
a workspace from an existing repository.</P>

<H3>Client Interface.</H3>

<P>For those who wish to &quot;roll their own&quot; MacCVS from the public
domain source, CMCVS requires a local copy of an application with the creator
code specified in the CMCVS Options preferences panel that implements the
DoScript AppleEvent {'misc', 'dosc'} with the following parameters:<BR>
<BR>
<SAMP>Do Command: Execute a CVS command<BR>
Do Command list -- Command line arguments, one per list item<BR>
[Mode AE/File] -- Mode (AE, File).<BR>
[Environment list] -- Environment variables.<BR>
[Filename string] -- Output file path.<BR>
[Pathway string] -- Starting pathway.<BR>
[NoLineBuffer boolean] -- if true, send each result line as separate AE.<BR>
</SAMP><BR>
Note that this is slightly different from the original event defined by
Mike Ladwig in that the arguments are no longer parsed from the list strings,
but copied directly. The keyword definitions are:</P>

<MENU>
  <P><SAMP>Mode 'MODE'</SAMP>
  <MENU>
    <P><SAMP>AE 'TOAE'<BR>
    File 'FILE'</SAMP>
  </MENU>
  <P><SAMP>Environment 'ENVT'<BR>
  Filename 'FILE'<BR>
  Pathway 'SPWD'<BR>
  <BR>
  NoLineBuffer 'LBUF'</SAMP>
</MENU>

<P>The environment variables are specified as pairs of adjacent entries
in a list, namely &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt;...
.</P>

<P>CMCVS also assumes that</P>

<UL>
  <LI>the local workspace looks like a GNU CVS workspace (e.g. <TT>CVS/Entries</TT>
  etc. are defined);
  <LI>the results of commands conforms substantially to the GNU <TT>stdout</TT>/<TT>stderr</TT>
  results;
  <LI>the <TT>.CVSPASS</TT> file is kept in the Preferences folder;
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="preparation"></A>Preparation.</H2>

<P><BR>
Before using CMCVS with a project, you must first have a CVS repository
that is available to you via TCP. <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/doc-cederqvist.html">Documentation</A>
on how to do this can be found in many places, but the best place to start
is probably the <A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_toc.html">Cederqvist
manual</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Next, you need to have a project folder created by the <TT>cvs checkout</TT>
command. We strongly recommend that you do the initial checkout with the
version of MacCVS that you will use with the plugin. We have found that
different versions of MacCVS have slightly different file formats which
are mutually incompatible.<BR>
<BR>
If you are using the recommended version of MacCVS, you can check in project
files by using the .mcp extension, so you may wish to rename your project
files. Also, if you have MacCVS configured to use Internet Config for extension
mapping, make sure that all the extensions in your project have the correct
mappings.</P>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2><A NAME="configuration"></A>Configuration.</H2>

<P><BR>
To configure a project for use with CMCVS, make sure that you have Desktop
VCS application running with a new configuration document open and set for
configuring CMCVS (<A HREF="index.html#use">directions</A>). Then do the
following:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Determine the setting of the $CVSROOT environment variable for the
  CVS repository that you wish to use;
  <LI>Select the&quot;VCS Setup&quot; panel;
  <LI>Make sure that &quot;Use version Control&quot; is checked;
  <LI>Choose &quot;CMCVS&quot; from the popup menu;
  <LI>Enter your CVS username (e.g. &quot;hawkfish&quot;) in the &quot;Username&quot;
  field (this becomes the $<CODE>LOGNAME</CODE> and <CODE>$USER</CODE> environment
  variables);
  <LI>The Password field is currently unused. Use the cvs login command in
  the MacCVS client;
  <LI>Use the &quot;Local Root&quot; control to choose the CVS checkout folder,
  or drag the folder into the path display;
  <LI>Use the &quot;Database Path&quot; control to choose any folder: as
  CVS does not use a file system database, we suggest choosing the &quot;Local
  Root&quot; folder. You may drag the folder from the local root folder.
  <LI>Click &quot;Save&quot;.
</OL>

<P>Next, you should configure the VCS Environment Prefs panel. This tells
CMCVS which repository you are talking to.To do configure it, do the following:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Select the &quot;VCS Environment&quot; panel;
  <LI>Click on the list entry containing the line <CODE>&quot;</CODE>CVSROOT=...<CODE>&quot;;</CODE>
  <LI>Edit the value of the <CODE>CVSROOT</CODE> environment variable;
  <LI>Click &quot;Add&quot;;
  <LI>Enter any other environment variables by entering the name and the
  value and clicking &quot;Add&quot;;
  <LI>Click &quot;Save&quot;.
</OL>

<P>Now, you should configure the VCSComment Prefs panel. This tells CMCVS
how to color files using the Finder's labels. To do this, do the following:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Select the &quot;VCS Comments&quot; control panel;
  <LI>CMCVS does not use the header comments preferences, so choose &quot;Never&quot;
  from the Header popup and ignore the initials and Copyright fields;
  <LI>If you wish to disable the Finder Label feature, uncheck the &quot;Use
  Finder Labels&quot; check box and skip the next step;
  <LI>Use the label pop ups to choose the labels that you wish to use for
  Checked out files, Checked in files and Orphaned (uncontrolled) files (CMCVS
  does not use the Modify-Read-Only label). These Finder Labels will be applied
  every time a file changes state;
  <LI>Click &quot;Save&quot;.
</OL>

<P>If you are an experienced CVS user, you may wish to configure the default
options for each command. To do this, do the following:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Open the CMCVS Options preferences panel;
  <LI>Enter the desired options;
  <LI>Click &quot;Save&quot;;
</OL>

<H4>Important Note:</H4>

<P>CVS maintains the &quot;Local Root&quot; directory specified above. It
is good practice to consider this directory as owned by CVS.<BR>

<H2><A NAME="vcsBasics"></A>Version Control Basics.</H2>

<H3>Introduction.</H3>

<P>This section is intended as a quick introduction to version control for
the novice. We will take as a model an abstract programming project that
may have one or more developers working on it and go through the entire
process from start to finish. Note that this is not intended to be a comprehensive
discussion of version control, nor is it our intention to imply that the
Contexutal Menu model or GNU CVS are the last word in version control. For
a list of all version control systems available for the Macintosh, as well
as pointers to other online resources about version control and configuration
management, please see our <A HREF="http://www.electricfish.com/hawkfish/macvcs/">Macintosh
VCS Page</A> on the net.</P>

<H3>The Contextual Menu interface.</H3>

<P>Before we begin, a word about Contextual Menus. CMCVS is a Contextual
Menu that you can access by holding down the control key and clicking on
a file or folder on your desktop. The menu has a submenu called Advanced
to bring up Advanced option dialogs for most commands. Folder (or Recursive)
commands apply to all the files under version control inside that folder
(or some obvious subset of them). You can also select a list of files from
the same folder.</P>

<H3>Getting started.</H3>

<P>Version control allows you to track different versions (or snapshots,
if you will) of the files used to make a program (or anything for that matter,
but we will stick to programming). While it is often used to keep track
of the work of several developers, it can also be used quite beneficially
by a single developer working alone. CMCVS itself has one developer, but
uses version control to keep the older versions of its source files, resource
files, project files and documentation organized and backed up. This manual
itself is one of the files kept under version control.</P>

<P>The most important thing that version control does is to specify a database
for storing all the versions of all the files in the project that is separate
from the versions being worked on by a developer. This database, in addition
to organizing all the revisions of all the files, also serves as a backup
for the project. The first thing you do (as described in the previous <A
HREF="#configuration">configuration</A> section) is specify a location for
the database. If the database you specify does not exist, CMCVS will not
allow you to connect. See the CVS <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/doc-cederqvist.html">documentation</A>
for information on how to set up a repository.</P>

<H3>Creating and editing files.</H3>

<P>So that now you have a database, how do you add files to it? After you
have added a new file to the project itself and are ready to preserve a
version of it, you add a new file to the database with the <A HREF="#addCommand">Add</A>
command in the CMCVS menu. CVS will then schedule the file to be added to
the database. You commit the new file to the database with the <A HREF=
"#checkinCommand">Checkin</A> command. After committing the change, CMCVS
locks the file so that you won't accidentally make changes to it.</P>

<P>Later on, you may need to make further changes to a file, say to add
a feature or fix a bug. To unlock a file, you use the <A HREF="#checkoutCommand">Checkout</A>
menu command. The file will then be unlocked and you can start working on
it. This is the part of the process that annoys many new users of version
control. Try to remember that what you gain from tracking your changes and
being deliberate about them generally outweighs the slight inconvenience
of the checkout process.</P>

<P>Now, the bug is fixed and you want to save your changes in the database.
You do this with the <A HREF="#checkinCommand">Checkin</A> menu command.
You will be prompted for a comment describing what you did to the file.
After checking in the file, the version in your workspace is locked again
to prevent you from making accidental changes to it.</P>

<P>Occasionally, you will start to make changes and realize that you have
been making them to the wrong file. If you check out a file in error, just
use the <A HREF="#undoCheckoutCommand">Undo Checkout</A> command to back
out your changes and get a fresh copy from the database.</P>

<P>If you are working with a group, or if you have several machines where
you work on your project, you may occasionally need to get individual files
or even the entire source tree from the repository. You do this with the
<A HREF="#getCommand">Get</A> and <A HREF="#getCommand">Recursive Get</A>
commands. These will make sure that you have the latest versions of all
your files. You can even get older versions of a file by using the Advanced
Get dialog.</P>

<H3>Getting information.</H3>

<P>One of the strengths of version control is that it enables you to track
down changes by asking the database questions. CVS (on which CMCVS is based)
allows you to ask it what files and revisions (snapshots) have certain properties.
You make these queries with the <A HREF="#historyCommand">History</A> and
<A HREF="#statusCommand">Status</A> commands. Another useful type of query
is to compare the contents of a file that you have in your workspace with
a version in the database, which is done with the <A HREF="#differenceCommand">Difference</A>
command. Finally, there is global information for the entire database (when
it was created, etc.) and this is available from the <A HREF="#variablesCommand">Variables</A>
command.</P>

<H3>File management.</H3>

<P>Over the course of a project, files are created and added, but they are
sometimes renamed, removed or even exported to another project. The <A 
HREF="#renameCommand">Rename</A> command allows you to rename a file. While
CMCVS implements this operation for you, CVS has no rename operation, so
a new file is created and the original history is part of the old file,
which is deleted. The <A HREF="#deleteCommand">Delete</A> command doesn't
actually delete the file, but it makes it so that it will not be used in
the project any more (you can undelete it in MacCVS, but Desktop VCS does
not currently have an interface for this operation).</P>

<P>Files are usually organized in a directory hierarchy, and CMCVS allows
you to create a matching hierarchical database as you add directories. To
do this, simply add a new file from the directory to the database. Be warned
that the directory on the server may be created with odd access permissions
that may have to be sorted out before other users can view these directories.</P>

<H3>Revision groups.</H3>

<P>It's now time for the first beta to be released. When you do this, you
may want to take a snapshot of the entire database. The <A HREF="#labelCommand">Recursive
Label</A> VCS command allows you to create a symbolic name (or label) for
this snapshot. This snapshot can be retrieved later with the <A HREF="#getCommand">Recursive
Get</A> command by using the Advanced version of the command and typing
in the label name.</P>

<H3>Miscellaneous topics.</H3>

<P>While all the operations described above are quite simple, requiring
at most a comment string or a label, there are sometimes other options that
you might want to specify, such as updating administrative information etc..
Choosing a command from the Advanced submenu will bring up a dialog box
allowing you to specify such options. Some of the options are obvious; others
(such as branching) are beyond the scope of this discussion. See the CVS
documentation for more information.</P>

<P>CVS stands for &quot;Concurrent Versions System&quot; which means that
several developers can be working on a file simultaneously. CVS merges changes
together when you check a file in, and notifies you of any conflicts. This
is usually not a problem, but it is quite different from most version control
systems. Of course, this doesn't work very well for binary files, but for
text it is extremely convenient.</P>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#contents">Contents</A>.<BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2><A NAME="commands"></A>Commands.</H2>

<P>CMCVS is a Contextual Menu that you can access by holding down the control
key and clicking on a file or folder on your desktop. (Some other applications
may also support the contextual menu context, used by CMCVS and you will
also see the CVS submenu appear when you control-click in them.) You can
only use CMCVS to operate on a folder or a set of files that are all in
the same folder.</P>

<P>Once the contextual menu has appeared, you can choose any of the following
commands from the CVS submenu:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Advanced
  <UL>
    <LI><A HREF="#getCommand">Get</A>
    <LI><A HREF="#checkinCommand">Checkin</A>
    <LI><A HREF="#historyCommand">History</A>
    <LI><A HREF="#statusCommand">Status</A>
    <LI><A HREF="#propertiesCommand">Properties</A>
    <LI><A HREF="#differenceCommand">Difference</A>
    <LI><A HREF="#addCommand">Add</A>
    <LI><A HREF="#renameCommand">Rename</A>
    <LI><A HREF="#labelCommand">Label</A>
  </UL>
  <LI>Synchronize Status
  <LI><A HREF="#getCommand">Get</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#checkoutCommand">Checkout</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#checkinCommand">Checkin</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#undoCheckoutCommand">Undo Checkout</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#historyCommand">History</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#statusCommand">Status</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#propertiesCommand">Properties</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#differenceCommand">Difference</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#commentCommand">Comment</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#addCommand">Add</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#deleteCommand">Delete</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#aboutCommand">About</A>
  <LI><A HREF="#variablesCommand">Variables</A>
</UL>

<P>All cvs commands use the directory of the file being manipulated as the
cwd, or the local root directory for Recursive commands.</P>

<H4>Kerberos.</H4>

<P>CMCVS attempts to make life pleasant for Kerberos users. Before each
command, $CVSROOT is checked to see if the &quot;:kserver:&quot; string
is present. If it is and if there is no valid ticket in the cache, the login
dialog is put up. Users who use Kerberos without the :kserver: option must
login separately.<BR>
<BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#contents">Contents</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="getCommand"></A>Get.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Get</I> command retrieves the current version of the file. The recursive
version updates all files in the project folder to their current versions.
All files are locked by default.</P>

<P>Advanced dialogs are also available for both versions of the Get command.
These dialogs allow you fairly complete access to all the various update
options provided by CVS. These options are in two groups. The first group
is used to make changes to the sticky tags associated with the file (or
with the entire project). As part of the Get, you can change the default
keyword expansion and update all the sticky tags associated with the file(s)
begin gotten. The option you are most likely to use here is &quot;Reset
sticky tags&quot; to update how a file is treated (e.g. a file has been
marked as binary and you need to copy that setting to your local workspace.)</P>

<P>The second group is used to specify which versions of the file and/or
directories are retrieved. The first two checkboxes allow you to specify
how any new or deleted directories in the repository are dealt with; the
Revision popup allows to specify which date or revision you wish to update
to; the last text fields allow you to merge branches of the source tree
into the workspace. The most common options you would use here are the directory
update options and specifying a particular revision to retrieve.</P>

<P>The cvs update command is quite complex and we recommend that you read
the cvs documentation before attempting to do anything sophisticated.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS commands are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs -rq update [-k&lt;keyword&gt;] [-A] [-P] [-d] [(-r &lt;revision&gt; | -D &lt;date&gt;) [-f]] [-j&lt;tag1&gt; [-j&lt;tag2&gt;]] &lt;file&gt;</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the recursive version. None of the options are specified by default<BR>
<BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="checkoutCommand"></A>Checkout.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Checkout</I> command makes a file available for writing. This consists
of notifying cvs that you are about to edit the file.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>Note that &quot;Checkout&quot; is the CMCVS's term for retrieving a file
with write permission. This is completely unrelated to the <TT>cvs checkout</TT>
command.</P>

<P>The actual CVS command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs -w edit &lt;file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="checkinCommand"></A>Checkin.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Checkin</I> command commits the current version of a file to the
repository and locks it. The recursive version commits all locally modified
files. You will be prompted for a comment that describes what you are did
to the file(s). After checkin, the file(s) will be locked (including the
project file).</P>

<P>Advanced dialogs are also available for both forms of the command. the
dialogs allow you to specify the branch or revision to commit to, and to
turn off module processing for the checkin.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS commands are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs -r commit [-r &lt;revision&gt;] [-n] -m &lt;comment&gt; &lt;file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the file version and:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs -r commit [-r &lt;revision&gt;] [-n] -R -m &lt;comment&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the recursive version. <BR>
<BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="undoCheckoutCommand"></A>Undo Checkout.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Undo checkout</I> command cancels the checkout of the file. It does
this by canceling the edit notification from the <A HREF="#checkoutCommand">Checkout</A>,
deleting the file and getting a fresh copy.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS commands used are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs -r unedit &lt;file&gt;
cvs -r update &lt;file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="historyCommand"></A>History.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>History</I> command displays a change history of the file obtained
from CVS. If you select multiple files, each one will appear in its own
window with a &quot;.history&quot; suffix. The recursive version returns
the history information for all files in the module.</P>

<P>The advanced dialog for the History command allows you to prune down
the revisions and text displayed. Consult the CVS documentation for more
information.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs log [-h | -t | -R] [-N] [-b] [-d &lt;dates&gt;] [-s &lt;status&gt;] [-r&lt;revisions&gt;] [-w&lt;editors&gt;] &lt;file&gt;</PRE>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="statusCommand"></A>Status.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Status</I> command displays the current state of the file, including
the revision numbers and sticky tags. If you select multiple files, each
one will appear in its own window with a &quot;.status&quot; suffix. The
recursive version of the command displays status information for the entire
project.</P>

<P>Advanced dialogs are also available for both versions of this command.
They allow you to list all tags associated with a file.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs status [-v] &lt;filename&gt;</PRE>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="propertiesCommand"></A>Properties.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Properties</I> command displays the watchers or editors of the file.
If you select multiple files, each one will appear in its own window with
a &quot;.watchers&quot; or &quot;.editors&quot; suffix. The recursive version
of the command displays watchers or editors for the entire project.</P>

<P>The advanced version of this command is used to toggle between displaying
the watchers and editors. Hold down the command key to display the editors.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS commands used are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs watchers &lt;filename&gt;

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="differenceCommand"></A>Difference.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Difference</I> command allows you to compare a file to the repository
version. If you select multiple files, each one will appear in its own window
with a &quot;.diff&quot; suffix.</P>

<P>The regular version compares the workspace version to the revision it
was derived from. The advanced version of the command allows you to specify
which revisions of the file to compare, how to expand RCS keywords and various
diff options. The recursive version will show the differences for every
text file that has been modified. The advanced recursive version will show
all differences between any sets of files in just about any manner you could
want.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS commands used are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs diff [-k&lt;keyword option&gt;] [-r &lt;tag1&gt; | -D &lt;date1&gt; [-r &lt;tag2&gt; | -D &lt;date2&gt;]] [-c] &lt;file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the regular version and:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs diff [-k&lt;keyword option&gt;] [-r &lt;tag1&gt; | -D &lt;date1&gt; [-r &lt;tag2&gt; | -D &lt;date2&gt;]] [-c]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the recursive version. Only the <TT>-c</TT> options is specified
by default.</P>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="labelCommand"></A>Label.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Label</I> command allows you to label the state of a module so that
you can refer to it later. The command will prompt you for a label to use
for the module. You can later use the Recursive <A HREF="#getCommand">Get</A>
command to retrieve this set of source and work with it.</P>

<P>CVS actually has two label commands: one labels the revisions currently
in your workspace; the other labels the revisions currently in the repository.
The regular Label command works with the revisions in the workspace and
the advanced Label command (available from the Advanced submenu) works with
the revisions in the repository.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS commands used are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs tag [-F] [-b] [-c] [-d] &lt;tag&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the regular command and:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs rtag [-F] [-a] [-c] [-d] [-R &lt;rev&gt; | -D &lt;date&gt;] [-f] &lt;tag&gt; &lt;local root name&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the recursive version. Only the <TT>-F</TT> option is specified by
default.</P>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="commentCommand"></A>Comment.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Comment</I> command allows you to change the checkin comment for
a version of a file. You will be asked for a new comment.</P>

<P>The regular version changes the comment for the file version that you
re currently working on. The advanced version of the command allows you
to specify which revision of the file to change the comment for.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs admin -m&lt;rev&gt;:&lt;msg&gt; &lt;file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>and for the Regular version of the command, <TT>&lt;rev&gt;</TT> is taken
from the <TT>:CVS:Entries</TT> file.</P>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="renameCommand"></A>Rename.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Rename</I> command changes a file's name in the repository. It does
this in the recommended manner, namely by renaming the file locally, deleting
the old file and adding the new file. After the rename, the file is labeled
as checked out and can now be checked in.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS/POSIX commands used are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>mv &lt;old name&gt;  &lt;new name&gt;
cvs remove &lt;old name&gt;
cvs add &lt;new name&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="addCommand"></A>Add.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Add</I> command adds a new file to the local repository. It does
not commit it. After the add command, the file is labeled as checked out
and can now be checked in. By default, non-text files are checked in as
binary files. By using the verion of the command in the Advanced submenu,
you can specify a file description and a keyword option for the file.</P>

<P>Before adding a file, the Add command checks to make sure that the directories
below the local root that contain the file are in the repository. If not,
it will prompt you (from the top down) to add the directory.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs add [-k&lt;keyword&gt; [-m &lt;description&gt;] &lt;file name&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The <TT>-kb</TT> option is specified by default for non-text files. When
adding a directory, the CVS command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs add &lt;directory name&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>with the cwd set to the directory's parent. The test to determine whether
the directory exists is simply to check for the <TT>CVS</TT> directory.</P>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="deleteCommand"></A>Delete.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Delete</I> command schedules a file to be deleted from the repository.
It does not commit the deletion. Use the <A HREF="#checkinCommand">Recursive
Checkin</A> command to commit the deletion. <BR>
After committing, the file is still in the repository attic, but CMCVS currently
has no interface for recovering it.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual CVS command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs remove &lt;file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="connectCommand"></A>Connect.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Connect</I> command makes sure that MacCVS is available and fails
if it is not. In addition, if you are using a <TT>pserver</TT> connection
method and you are not logged in using the username/password specified,
CMCVS will attempt to log you in. If your password is not valid, the connect
will fail.</P>

<H4>CVS Commands.</H4>

<P>If the connection method is <TT>pserver</TT> then a <TT>cvs login</TT>
is faked by adding the password to the <TT>.cvspass</TT> file and then attempting
to issue a</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>cvs -nq update -l</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>command. If this fails, the <TT>.cvspass</TT> file is restored and the
connection fails.</P>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="disconnectCommand"></A>Disconnect.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Disconnect</I> command is currently a nop.<BR>
