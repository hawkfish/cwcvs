<H2><A NAME="description"></A>Description.</H2>

<P><BR>
CMProjector is a Contextual Menu Module which provides access to the MPW
Projector system from the Finder desktop.</P>

<P>CMProjector provides an easy to use source-code control system, at minimal
cost, using established technology from Apple. It is well suited for individuals
and small organizations which want the benefits of source-control with a
minimum of hassle and expense.</P>

<P>If you are new to version control, you may wish to start by reading the
<A HREF="#vcsBasics">Version Control Basics</A> section. Otherwise, keep
reading.<BR>

<H2><A NAME="features"></A>Features.</H2>

<P>CMProjector provides the standard functions of most source-code control
systems:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Create;
  <LI>Get copies;
  <LI>File management (Add, Rename, Delete);
  <LI>Check out/in;
  <LI>Report generation;
</UL>

<P>and several additional features:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>integration with Finder's labeling.<BR>
  <BR>
  Files are labeled, and thus colored, by their status. This makes it easy
  to glance at a project window in the Finder and see which files are checked-out,
  just by looking at their color. You can customize the label assignments.
  This functionality is controlled by the VCSComments Pref panel. <BR>
  
  <LI>automated &quot;DTS MPW Goodies&quot; format header comments<BR>
  <BR>
  Use of this feature enforces consistent headers describing source files,
  including the name, author, contents, copyright and change history for
  a file. This functionality is controlled by the VCSComments Pref panel.

<H2><A NAME="requirements"></A>Requirements.</H2>

<P><BR>
CMProjector requires a version of the MacOS that supports Contextual Menus,
Navigation Services and the Appearance Manager .<BR>
<BR>
CMProjector also requires that you install a version of MPW SourceServer
on your machine. SourceServer, a standalone application that provides access
to most of the Projector commands found in the MPW shell, can be <A HREF=
"ftp://ftp.apple.com/devworld/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_Website_Downloads/SourceServer-3.5d4.hqx">downloaded</A>
it from Apple's ftp site. For system 8.5 we recommend at least SourceServer
version 3.5d4 from Apple. Be aware that SourceServer will not work when
run from a remote volume - you must have it locally on your drive.</P>

<P>The default application for doing text-based Differences is <A HREF=
"http://www.barebones.com/">Bare Bones Software</A>'s <A HREF="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/bbedit.html">BBEdit</A>.
The default application for doing resource-based Differences is <A HREF=

<H2><A NAME="preparation"></A>Preparation.</H2>

<P>Prior to using CMProjector with a project, you must first decide where
you wish to keep the Projector database. If your project already has one,
you only need to make sure that the volume is mounted. If you don't have
a Projector database, CMProjector can create on for you, but you must create
an <EM>empty</EM> folder in the desired location with the desired name (so
that the Desktop VCS application can be pointed at it). The first time you
connect, CMProjector will convert this folder to a Projector database. CMProjector
works with subdatabases, but it requires that the main database be a top-level
database.<BR>
<BR>
The Desktop VCS version control model assumes that all the files subject
to version control are in a single directory hierarchy. CMProjector interprets
this as a directory hierarchy that matches the Projector database hierarchy,
so make sure that your files are in this form. This also means that while
CMProjector can easily handle a database with multiple subdatabases, it
does not let you switch to a different top-level database or use multiple
top-level databases. <BR>
<BR>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2><A NAME="configuration"></A>Configuration.</H2>

<P><BR>
To configure a project for use with CMProjector, make sure that you have
Desktop VCS application running with a new configuration document open (<A
HREF="index.html#use">directions</A>). Then do the following:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Determine the location of the <I>top-level </I>Projector database you
  wish to use;
  <LI>Select the VCS Setup panel;
  <LI>Choose &quot;CMProjector&quot; from the popup menu;
  <LI>Enter your Projector username (e.g. &quot;Richard Wesley&quot;) in
  the &quot;Username&quot; field;
  <LI>Projector does not currently use passwords;
  <LI>Use the &quot;Database Path&quot; control to choose the Projector database
  folder;
  <LI>Use the &quot;Local Root&quot; control to choose the corresponding
  project folder;
  <LI>Click &quot;Save&quot;.
</OL>

<P>At this point, you should configure the VCSComment Prefs panel. To do
this, do the following:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Select the &quot;VCS Comments&quot; control panel;
  <LI>Select how you want to use Header Comments from the popup menu. If
  you want to automatically generate header comments whenever they are missing,
  choose &quot;Always&quot;. If you wish to be asked for each file, choose
  &quot;Ask User&quot;. If you do not wish to use header comments, choose
  &quot;Never&quot; and skip the next two steps;
  <LI>Enter the initials (e.g. rmgw) that you wish to have next to your comments
  in the Initials field;
  <LI>Enter the copyright information for the project in the Copyright field;
  <LI>If you wish to disable the Finder Label feature, uncheck the &quot;Use
  Finder Labels&quot; check box and skip the next step;
  <LI>Use the label pop ups to choose the labels that you wish to use for
  Checked out files, Checked in files, Modify-Read-Only files and Orphaned
  files. These Finder Labels will be applied every time a file changes state;
  <LI>Click &quot;Save&quot;.
</OL>

<P>If you are an experienced Projector user you may wish to configure the
default options for each command. To do this, do the following:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Open the CMProjector Options control panel;
  <LI>Select the desired defaults;
  <LI>Click &quot;Save;
</OL>

<H4>Important Note:</H4>

<P>CMProjector maintains the &quot;Local Root&quot; directory specified
above. It is good practice to consider this directory owned by CMProjector.
For example, CMProjector will delete obsoleted files from this directory
when performing a Recursive <A HREF="#getCommand">Get</A> operation. <BR>

<H2><A NAME="vcsBasics"></A>Version Control Basics.</H2>

<H3>Introduction.</H3>

<P>This section is intended as a quick introduction to version control for
the novice. We will take as a model an abstract programming project that
may have one or more developers working on it and go through the entire
process from start to finish. Note that this is not intended to be a comprehensive
discussion of version control, nor is it our intention to imply that the
Contexutal Menu model or MPW Projector are the last word in version control.
For a list of all version control systems available for the Macintosh, as
well as pointers to other online resources about version control and configuration
management, please see our <A HREF="http://www.electricfish.com/hawkfish/macvcs/">Macintosh
VCS Page</A> on the net.</P>

<H3>The Contextual Menu interface.</H3>

<P>Before we begin, a word about Contextual Menus. CMProjector is a Contextual
Menu that you can access by holding down the control key and clicking on
a file or folder on your desktop. The menu has a submenu called Advanced
to bring up Advanced option dialogs for most commands. Folder (or Recursive)
commands apply to all the files under version control inside that folder
(or some obvious subset of them).</P>

<H3>Getting started.</H3>

<P>Version control allows you to track different versions (or snapshots,
if you will) of the files used to make a program (or anything for that matter,
but we will stick to programming). While it is often used to keep track
of the work of several developers, it can also be used quite beneficially
by a single developer working alone. CMProjector itself has one developer,
but uses version control to keep the older versions of its source files,
resource files, project files and documentation organized and backed up.
This manual itself is one of the files kept under version control.</P>

<P>The most important thing that version control does is to specify a database
for storing all the versions of all the files in the project that is separate
from the versions being worked on by a developer. This database, in addition
to organizing all the revisions of all the files, also serves as a backup
for the project. The first thing you do (as described in the previous <A
HREF="#configuration">configuration</A> section) is specify a location for
the database. If the database you specify does not exist, CMProjector will
create one for you when you start up version control for a project.</P>

<H3>Creating and editing files.</H3>

<P>So that now you have a database, how do you add files to it? After you
are ready to preserve a version of it, you add a new file to the database
with the <A HREF="#addCommand">Add</A> command in the CMProjector menu.
A copy of the file is then added to the database and the version you have
in your workspace is locked to prevent you from making accidental changes
to it. When you add the file, you must specify a change comment describing
what you did. This happens every time you submit a file to the database,
making it easier to go back and find when you made certain changes.</P>

<P>Later on, you may need to make further changes to a file, say to add
a feature or fix a bug. You need to tell the database that you want to make
changes to the file and keep other developers from making changes to that
file while you are working on it. You do this with the <A HREF="#checkoutCommand">Checkout</A>
menu command. You will be asked for a comment describing what you intend
to do with the file (which can be very useful if you forget before you check
it in) and the file will then be unlocked and you can start working on it.
This is the part of the process that annoys many new users of version control.
Try to remember that what you gain from tracking your changes and being
deliberate about them usually outweighs the slight inconvenience of the
checkout process.</P>

<P>Now, the bug is fixed and you want to save your changes in the database.
You do this with the <A HREF="#checkinCommand">Checkin</A> menu command.
You will again be prompted for a comment describing what you did to the
file. The checkout comment is the default in the dialog. After checking
in the file, the version in your workspace is locked again to prevent you
from making accidental changes to it.</P>

<P>Occasionally, you will start to make changes and realize that you have
been making them to the wrong file. If you check out a file in error, just
use the <A HREF="#undoCheckoutCommand">Undo Checkout</A> command to back
out your changes.</P>

<P>If you are working with a group, or if you have several machine where
you work on your project, you may occasionally need to get individual files
or even the entire source tree from the repository. You do this with the
<A HREF="#getCommand">Get</A> and <A HREF="#getCommand">Recursive Get</A>
commands. These will make sure that you have the latest versions of all
your files. You can even get older versions of a file by using the Advanced
Get dialog.</P>

<P>CMProjector provides a useful feature called &quot;Header Comments&quot;
as part of the checkout/checkin process. If you enable this feature, CMProjector
will place a running history of the checkin comments with dates and initials
at the top of each source file. This can be very handy for tracking down
changes quickly. You can also get this information from the database, but
it is a separate command and requires the database. CMProjector can also
change the Finder Label of files to match their checkout state, which can
be a useful way of tracking what files you are modifying.</P>

<H3>Getting information.</H3>

<P>One of the strengths of version control is that it enables you to track
down changes by asking the database questions. Projector (on which CMProjector
is based) allows you to ask it what files and revisions (snapshots) have
certain properties. You make these queries with the <A HREF="#propertiesCommand">Properties</A>,
<A HREF="#historyCommand">History</A> and <A HREF="#statusCommand">Status</A>
commands. Another useful type of query is to compare the contents of a file
that you have in your workspace with a version in the database, which is
done with the <A HREF="#differenceCommand">Difference</A> command. Finally,
there is global information for the entire database (when it was created,
etc.) and this is available from the <A HREF="#variablesCommand">Variables</A>
command.</P>

<H3>File management.</H3>

<P>Over the course of a project, files are created and added, but they are
sometimes renamed, removed or even exported to another project. The <A 
HREF="#renameCommand">Rename</A> command allows you to rename a file. The
<A HREF="#deleteCommand">Delete</A> command doesn't actually delete the
file, but it makes it so that it will not be used in the project any more
(you can undelete it in MPW, but Desktop VCS does not currently have an
interface for this operation). The <A HREF="#purgeCommand">Purge</A> command
is used to remove the version control information from a file so that it
can be added to another database.</P>

<P>Files are usually organized in a directory hierarchy, and CMProjector
allows you to create a matching hierarchical database as you add directories.
To do this, simply add a new file from the directory to the database.</P>

<H3>Revision groups.</H3>

<P>It's now time for the first beta to be released. When you do this, you
may want to take a snapshot of the entire database. The <A HREF="#labelCommand">Recursive
Label</A> menu command allows you to create a symbolic name (or label) for
this snapshot. This snapshot can be retrieved later by using the <A HREF=
"#getCommand">Get</A> command from the Advanced submenu on a folder and
choosing the label from the popup. Files can also be labeled one at a time
with the <A HREF="#labelCommand">Label</A> command to allow you to refer
to a group of related changes as a unit.</P>

<H3>Miscellaneous topics.</H3>

<P>While all the operations described above are quite simple, requiring
at most a comment string or a label, there are sometimes other options that
you might want to specify, such as keeping a file checked out when checking
it in and so on. Choosing a command from theAdvanced submenu will bring
up a dialog box allowing you to specify such options for the command. Some
of the options are obvious; others (such as branching) are beyond the scope
of this discussion. See the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.apple.com/devworld/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./Documentation/MPW_Reference/MPW_Command_Reference.sit.hqx">MPW

</UL>

<P><BR>
Note that the command names are taken from the CodeWarrior IDE. If you are
a devoted Projector user, please refer to the command descriptions to determine
what each one does.</P>

<P>Note also that the default behavior for each command can be customized
in the &quot;CMProjector Options&quot; preferences panel. The options in
this panel correspond to the check boxes in the advanced dialogs and are
the options used in the regular versions of the commands.<BR>
<BR>
If you are unfamiliar with the Projector commands and would like to learn
more, please refer to the Apple manuals &quot;<A HREF="ftp://ftp.apple.com/devworld/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./Documentation/MPW_Reference/Bldg%26Mng_Progs_In_MPW.sit.hqx">Building

Return to the <A HREF="#contents">Contents</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="getCommand"></A>Get.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Get</I> command retrieves file versions from the Projector database.
It has a folder version that allows you to update an entire folder and advanced
versions that allow you to customize the checkout. The Get command will
also check to see if the file is ModifyReadOnly and ask you if you wish
to discard the changes. If the file does not exist, CMProjector will still
attempt to get the file.<BR>
<BR>
The regular Get command simply gets the latest version of a file from the
database. The regular Recursive Get command refreshes the entire project
folder with the latest versions of all files and deletes any obsolete files.
These are the most common operations that you would want to perform.<BR>
<BR>
The advanced Get commands (available from the submenu) allow simple access
to the Projector CheckOut command in all its baroque glory. We have attempted
to provide options that we believe that most users will want access to.
The advanced version of the regular Get command allows you to specify several
options and to choose which version of the file you wish to CheckOut. The
advanced version of the Recursive Get command again allows you to select
among various options, but also to choose between getting the latest versions
of all the files or getting a particular NameRevision (which is called a
Label by CMProjector). You can define NameRevisions from CMProjector using
the <A HREF="#labelCommand">Label</A> command.</P>

<H4>Projector Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual Projector commands are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>CheckOut &lt;options&gt; -d &lt;dir&gt; -project &lt;project&gt; &lt;file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the single file version and:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>CheckOutDir -r -project &lt;project&gt; &lt;dir&gt;
CheckOut &lt;options&gt; -r -project &lt;project&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the recursive version. The default options for the regular version
of these commands are described below.</P>

<P>The advanced options available for the Get command are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><SAMP>[-history] [-noTouch] [-verify]</SAMP></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><SAMP>-noTouch</SAMP> is specified by default. In addition, specific
versions of the file may be chosen from a list.<BR>
<BR>
The advanced options available for the Recursive Get command are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><SAMP>[-deleteObsolete] [-history] [-noTouch] [-verify] [-newer | &lt;label&gt;]</SAMP></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><SAMP><BR>
-deleteObsolete, -noTouch</SAMP> and <SAMP>-newer </SAMP>are specified by

The commands:</P>

<PRE>OrphanFiles &lt;file&gt;
CheckOut -y -d &lt;dir&gt; -project &lt;project&gt; &lt;file&gt;</PRE>

<P><BR>
are used for MRO files.<BR>
<BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="checkoutCommand"></A>Checkout.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Checkout</I> command retrieves the latest version of the file from
the Projector database and makes it available for writing. You will be prompted
for a comment that describes what you are doing. If you are using header
comments, this comment will be added to the header. The Checkout command
will also check to see if the file is ModifyReadOnly and ask you if you
wish to discard the changes. The advanced Checkout command allows you to
specify various Projector Checkout options such as the task name and file
verification.</P>

<P>There is also a Recursive version of the Checkout command. All this does
is a tree walk allowing you to check out all the files you have locally.
The Advanced version will put up the checkout dialog for <I>each</I> file.
This Recursive variation should not be used casually as this tends to defeat
the purpose of Version Control (not to mention being highly obnoxious in
a shared environment!) It is mostly useful for when you have to change every
file at once. If there is any file that you do not need to modify in the
edit, you should strongly consider checking the files out individually.</P>

<H4>Projector Commands.</H4>

<P>Note that this is slightly different from the Projector CheckOut command
which also allows you to retrieve a file read-only. In CMProjector this
functionality is provided by the <A HREF="#getCommand">Get</A> command.</P>

<P>The actual Projector command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>CheckOut -m &lt;options&gt; -cs &lt;comment&gt; -d &lt;dir&gt; -project &lt;project&gt; -u &lt;user&gt; &lt;file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The advanced options dialog (available from the Advanced submenu) brings
up a dialog that allows you to specify the following options:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>[<SAMP>-b] [-history] [-noTouch] [-verify] [-t &lt;task&gt;]</SAMP></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><SAMP><BR>
</SAMP>as well as the version you wish to check out. <SAMP>-noTouch</SAMP>
and the latest version are specified by default.<BR>

<H3><A NAME="makeWriteableCommand"></A>Make Writeable.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Make Writeable</I> command allows you to modify a file without checking
it out of the database. This can be useful if the database is not available
or if you want to make temporarly local changes.</P>

<H3>Checkin.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Checkin</I> command returns the edited version of the file to the
Projector database and locks it. You will be prompted for a comment that
describes what you are did to the file. If you are using header comments,
this comment will be added to the header. If you specified a task name during
<A HREF="#checkoutCommand">Checkout</A> or later via the Advanced <A HREF=
"#commentCommand">Comment</A> command, that task will be used for the checkin.</P>

<P>The Advanced Checkin command allows you to specify several checkin options,
including changing the task name and a new version name. If you specify
a new version name it must be numerically greater than the current version.</P>

<P>The recursive versions of the checkin command walk the specified directory
searching for files that are checked out or MRO. It then prompts you to
check in each one. It is just as if you selected all the checked out files
in the project window and chose Checkin.</P>

<H4>Projector Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual Projector command used is:</P>

<H3>Undo Checkout.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Undo Checkout</I> command cancels the checkout of the file. It can
also be used with an MRO file by holding down the command key.</P>

<P>The recursive version prompts you to cancel the checkout of all checked
out or MRO files. It is just as if you selected all the checked out or MRO
files in the project window and chose Undo Checkout.</P>

The <I>History</I> command displays a change history of the file obtained
from the Projector database. It displays information for each revision in
the database, including the author, checkin date, task and comment fields.
If you select multiple files, the history for each file will be displayed
one at a time in a scrolling text field that you can save. The recursive
version returns the comment information for all file revisions in the project
that are checked out for modification (this is because returning all information
for all files will probably overflow the SourceServer return buffer). The
History command also supports advanced versions of both the regular and
recursive commands.</P>

<P>The Advanced version of the command allows you to filter the reporting
of the versions of the selected files by giving a matching pattern for the
author, comment, modification dates, task and name, or by specifying the
latest trunk version. Leaving a field blank means that no filtering is done
with it. You may also specify whether the history of each file appears in
its own window or in a single window; that file information only be displayed;
and that a short listing be given. The latter causes the comments to be
stripped out, giving you only a list of version or the history.</P>

<P>The Advanced Recursive version of the command allows you to specify the
versions of the selected files as in the Advanced version, as well as specifying
which files are reported on. Files can be specified by author, comment and
date, and by various version tests. The popup allows you to ask for all
files or files that there are newer versions of in the database than the
ones you have, including or excluding any new files you don't have copies
of yet. You can also ask for only the files that someone has open for modification,
which can be very useful for making sure you have everything checked in
(finding &quot;lurkers&quot;). Finally, you can specify short listings as
for the regular version of the command.</P>

<H4><A NAME="infoFormats"></A>Formats:</H4>

<P>For the author, comments and task, you can specify a pattern that the
field must contain, either a literal string, or a regular expression enclosed
in forward slashes (/).</P>

<P>The date can be specified as follows:</P>

<DL>
  <DD><I>date </I>On the specified <I>date</I>
  <DD><I>&lt;date </I>Before but not including <I>date</I>
  <DD><I>&lt;=date </I>Before and including <I>date </I>(option-&lt;)
  <DD><I>&gt;date </I>After but not including <I>date</I>
  <DD><I>=&gt;date </I>After and including <I>date</I> (option-&gt;)
  <DD><I>date1</I>-<I>date2 </I>Between and including <I>date1 </I>and <I>date2</I>
</DL>

<P>A date used in a date expression can be specified as</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>mm</I>/<I>dd</I>/<I>yy </I>[ <I>hh</I>:<I>mm </I>[:<I>ss </I>] AM|PM
  ]</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>where <I>mm</I>, <I>dd</I>, and <I>yy </I>represent the month, day, and
year; <I>hh</I>, <I>mm</I>, and <I>ss</I> represent the hour, minute, and
second; and AM and PM indicate an A.M. or P.M. time.</P>

<P>For the name, you can specify either a label name or a version number.
The name can be specified as follows:</P>

<DL>
  <DD><I>label </I>The version represented by <I>name</I>
  <DD>&lt;<I>name </I>Before but not including <I>name</I>
  <DD><I>&lt;=name </I>Before and including <I>name</I> (option-&lt;)

<H4>Projector Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual Projector command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>ProjectInfo &lt;filename&gt; -project &lt;project&gt; -comments &lt;file name&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the regular version and:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>ProjectInfo &lt;filename&gt; -project &lt;project&gt; -comments -r</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the recursive version. The Advanced version adds the options:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>[-a &lt;author&gt;] [-c &lt;comment&gt;] [-d &lt;date&gt;] [-n &lt;name&gt;] [-t &lt;task&gt;] [-latest] [-f] [-s]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>and the Advanced Recursive version adds the options:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>[-newer | -update] [-af &lt;author&gt;] [-cf &lt;comment&gt;] [-df &lt;date&gt;] [-m] [-s]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="statusCommand"></A>Status.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Status</I> command displays the current state of the file, as recorded
in the 'ckid' resource and updates the displayed status in the Finder. If
you select multiple files, the status for each file will displayed one at
a time in a separate window that you can save.</P>

<P>The recursive version checks the status of every file in the specified
directory and places the results in a single window. Only files with 'ckid'
resources are reported, but the Finder status of every file is updated.
This is very useful for synchronizing the status with the disk and also
for forcing the Finder to update.</P>

<P>The Advanced version of the command allows you to specify that a single
window is used.</P>

<P>The Advanced Recursive version doesn't actually put up a dialog, but
reports only those files that are checked out or MRO.</P>

<H4>Projector Commands.</H4>

<P>No Projector commands are used.<BR>
<BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="propertiesCommand"></A>Properties.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Properties</I> command displays the current state of the file, including
the author, creation and modification dates and whether the file can be
checked out. If you select multiple files, the status for each file will
displayed one at a time in a separate window with that you can save.</P>

<P>The Properties command is actually almost identical to the <A HREF="#historyCommand">History</A>
command, except that Properties doesn't display the checkin comments for
non-short listings.</P>

<H4>Projector Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual Projector commands used are the same as for the <A HREF="#historyCommand">History</A>
command, except that the</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>-comment</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>option is not specified.</P>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="differenceCommand"></A>Difference.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Difference</I> command displays the differences between the version
of a text or resource file in your workspace and a version in the database.
The regular version compares the main trunk revision and the advanced version
of the command allows you to specify which version of the file to compare
with the disk version. The recursive version will show the differences for
every file that is checked out or MRO as compared to the main trunk revision.</P>

<P>Difference is accomplished by use of helper applications. The default
helper for text files is a helper application that translates the event
for <A HREF="http://www.barebones.com/">Bare Bones Software</A>'s <A HREF=
"http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/bbedit.html">BBEdit</A> and the
default for resource (<TT>RSRC</TT>, <TT>rsrc</TT>) files is <A HREF="http://www.mathemaesthetics.com/">Mathemaesthetics</A>'
<A HREF="http://www.mathemaesthetics.com/ResorcererInfo.html">Resourcerer</A>.</P>

<H4>Projector Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual Projector commands used are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>CheckOut -d &lt;temporary dir&gt; -project &lt;file project&gt; &lt;file name&gt;[,&lt;version&gt;]</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>AppleEvent definition.</H4>

<P>The helper applications mapping is described by the <TT>CTM#</TT> resource.
The Compare Apple Event used is as follows:</P>

<PRE>	Class: Comp
	Event: Comp
	Parameters:
		Newer file: kNew (typeFSS)
		Older file: kOld (typeFSS)
		Show difference: kShD (typeBoolean)</PRE>

<P>You may need to write a mapping applet to translate the event to your
helper application.</P>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="commentCommand"></A>Comment.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Comment</I> command allows you to change the Checkout comment for
a file. The comment is changed in the 'ckid' resource and in the header
comment. The advanced version of the command changes the Checkout Task Name
for a file in the 'ckid' instead of the comment.</P>

<P>The recursive versions of the command specify the comment/task name for
all checked out or MRO files in the specified folder.</P>

<H4>Projector Commands.</H4>

<P>No Projector commands are used.<BR>
<BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="labelCommand"></A>Label.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Label</I> command allows you to label a group of files so that you
can refer to them later as a group. The regular versions of the command
simply list all the labels associated with the file or project in question.
The advanced versions of the command will prompt you for a label to use
for all selected files. You may later use a label you have defined in the
advanced recursive <A HREF="#getCommand">Get</A> command. Note: This is
not the same as Finder coloring (which is also called Labeling).</P>

<P>In addition to the name of the Label, you may also specify whether you
wish to replace an existing label with the same name, have the label always
refer to the latest version of a file or specify that the local revision
that you have in your workspace be the revision used. The last two options
are mutually exclusive, and if neither is specified, the labeled revision
will the the latest version checked in.</P>

<H4>Projector Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual Projector commands used are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>NameRevisions -project &lt;project&gt; &lt;file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for regular files,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>NameRevisions &lt;label&gt; [-replace] [-dynamic] -u &lt;user&gt; -project &lt;project&gt; &lt;revision&gt;...</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for advanced files and for the advanced recursive version with local
revisions specified,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>NameRevisions -project &lt;project&gt; -r -only</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the recursive version and</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>NameRevisions &lt;label&gt; [-replace] [-dynamic] -u &lt;user&gt; -project &lt;project&gt; -r -a</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>for the advanced recursive version. When specified, the replace option
is only used for the first Projector command used in the VCS command. <BR>
<BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="renameCommand"></A>Rename.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Rename</I> command allows you to rename a file in the Projector database.
CMProjector will prompt you for a new name for each file, renames the file
in the database, orphans the old file and checks out the new file for you.</P>

<H4>Projector Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual Projector commands used are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>RenameProjectorFile -project &lt;project&gt; -u &lt;user&gt; &lt;filename&gt; &lt;new name&gt;
OrphanFile &lt;file&gt;
CheckOut -d &lt;dir&gt; -project &lt;project&gt; &lt;new file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>
Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="addCommand"></A>Add.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Add</I> command checks a new file into the Projector database. If
you are using Header Comments, you will be asked to give a brief description
of the contents of the file for the header. If the file already has a header
comment, you will be asked whether you wish to reuse it. if you answer yes,
the entire header (including the old change history) will be kept and a
new history started at the top of the change history section.<BR>
<BR>
If the file is in a folder for which there is no corresponding subdatabase,
CMProjector will attempt to create subdatabases. For each subdatabase, you
will be asked if you wish to create it and for a creation comment. If you
cancel at any point, the Add will fail and that particular subdatabase will
not be created. Previously created databases will not be backed out.</P>

<H4>Projector Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual Projector command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>CheckIn [&lt;options&gt;] -new -cs &lt;comment&gt; -project &lt;project&gt; -u &lt;user&gt; &lt;file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The advanced options dialog (available from the Advanced submenu) brings
up a dialog that allows you to specify the following options:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><SAMP>[-m | -delete] [-touch] [-verify]</SAMP> <SAMP>[-t &lt;task&gt;]</SAMP></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The task is set to the last task you entered (if any). None of the options
are specified by default.<BR>
<BR>
For subproject creation, the command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>NewProject -u &lt;user&gt; -cs &lt;comment&gt; &lt;database path&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="deleteCommand"></A>Delete.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Delete</I> command removes a file from the Projector database and
orphans the file.<BR>
<BR>
After deletion, the file is still in the database as an obsoleted file,
but CMProjector has no interface for recovering it. You must use the MPW
command UnObsoleteProjectorFile.</P>

<H4>Projector Commands.</H4>

<P>The actual Projector command used is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>ObsoleteProjectorFile -project &lt;project&gt; -u &lt;user&gt; &lt;file&gt;
OrphanFiles &lt;file&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>
The MPW shell syntax for the Projector UnObsoleteProjectorFile command is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>UnObsoleteProjectorFile -project &lt;project&gt; -u &lt;user&gt; &lt;file name&gt;</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Return to the <A HREF="#commands">Commands</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="purgeCommand"></A>Purge.</H3>

<P><BR>
The <I>Purge</I> command orphans the file but does not remove it from the
database. The Recursive version orphans every file in the specified directory.
You will be prompted for each file and can specify &quot;Yes&quot; to orphan
the file, &quot;No&quot; to skip a file and &quot;Cancel&quot; to abort
the rest of the operation.<BR>
<BR>
After purging, the file is still in the database, but the local copy has
no 'ckid' resource and the Finder will display it as not being in the database.
To recover the file, you must use the <A HREF="#getCommand">Get</A> command.</P>

<P>Purge is most useful for importing files from another database. You copy
the file into the local source directory and add it to the project. After
Purging the file, you can now add it to the current database.</P>

<P>The Recursive Purge command is most useful for exporting a source tree.
After <A HREF="#getCommand">getting</A> copies of all the files to export,
you can issue the Recursive Purge to orphan all the files. You can then
connect to a new database and start <A HREF="#addCommand">adding</A> the
files again.</P>
