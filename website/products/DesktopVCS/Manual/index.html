<H2><A NAME="features"></A>Features.</H2>

<P>Desktop VCS provides the standard functions of most source-code control
systems:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Create;
  <LI>Get copies;
  <LI>File management (Add, Rename, Delete);
  <LI>Check out/in;
  <LI>Report generation;
</UL>

<P>This functionality is provided by two Contextual Menu modules, <A HREF=
"CMProjector.html#features">CMProjector</A> and <A HREF="CMCVS.html#features">CMCVS</A>.
In addition, the Desktop VCS application allows you to easily configure
the menus for use in the Finder or any Contextual Menu aware application.</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2><A NAME="requirements"></A>Requirements.</H2>

<P><BR>
Desktop VCS requires a version MacOS that supports Contextual Menus, Navigation
Services and the Appearance Manager. MacOS 8.5 is sufficient. The Contextual
Menu modules <A HREF="CMProjector.html#requirements">CMProjector</A> and
<A HREF="CMCVS.html#requirements">CMCVS </A>also have their own requirements.<BR>

<H2><A NAME="use"></A>The Desktop VCS Application.</H2>

<P>The Desktop VCS application allows you to create and edit configuration
documents for the Contextual menu modules. These files are needed to associate
a directory with a version control system and to customize the behavior
of the modules.</P>

<P>The first decision that you need to make is which system to use. Probably
the easiest to get set up and running is MPW Projector, and this is what
we recommend for novices. Consult the submanuals for the <A HREF="CMProjector.html#description">CMProjector</A>
and <A HREF="CMCVS.html#description">CMCVS</A> modules for more information.</P>

<H4>Creating a new configuration.</H4>

<P>If the Desktop VCS application is not running, simply double click on
the application icon in the Finder and it will start a new configuration
for you. If the application is already running, go to the File menu and
choose the New command.</P>

<H4>Selecting the Contextual Menu module.</H4>

<P>There are two Contextual Menu modules available in this release of Desktop
VCS. Each module uses a different set of control panels which will appear
when you choose a module name from the Method popup. The default is <A 
HREF="CMProjector.html#configuration">CMProjector</A>, but if you wish to
use <A HREF="CMCVS.html#configuration">CMCVS</A>, you can choose if from
the popup.</P>

<P>Once you have chosen a module, you will need to read the Configuration
section of the manual for that module. Please follow the appropriate link:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="CMProjector.html#configuration">CMProjector</A>
  <LI><A HREF="CMCVS.html#configuration">CMCVS</A>
</UL>

<H4>Saving the Configuration.</H4>

<P>When you have finished creating a configuration for a module, you will
need to save it so that the module can find that information. Each module
saves its configurations in a special configuration folder in the Preferences
folder. When you save a configuration for the first time, you will be asked
to name it in the usual way, but the default location to save in will be
the configuration folder for the module you have chosen. You can save the
configuration file in another location, but the module will not be able
to see it until it is placed in the configuration folder.</P>

<H4>Editing a Configuration.</H4>

<P>You can edit a configuration at any time by choosing Open from the File
menu or by double clicking on the configuration file. When you have finished
making the changes, simply resave the file and your changes should be available
immediately.<BR>
