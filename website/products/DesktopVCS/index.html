<H2>Description.</H2>

<P>Desktop VCS integrates the MPW Projector and GNU CVS version control
systems into your Finder desktop using Contextual Menu Modules and a configuration
application.</P>

<P>CMProjector is a Contextual Menu Module which provides access to the
MPW Projector system from the Finder desktop. CMProjector provides an easy
to use source-code control system, at minimal cost, using established technology
from Apple. It is well suited for individuals and small organizations which
want the benefits of source-control with a minimum of hassle and expense.</P>

<P>CVS is a widely used POSIX-based version control system and CVS clients
are available on many platforms, including the Macintosh, making it a reasonable
choice for multiple platform development. The CMCVS contextual menu allows
you to use CVS from the Finder desktop without arcane command line arguments
or scripts.</P>

<P>The Dekstop VCS application allows you to create and edit settings documents
for the Contextual Menus. it is fully AppleScriptable and supports infinite
undo.</P>
