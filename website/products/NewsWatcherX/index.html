<H2>What is it?</H2>

<P>NewsWatcher-X is a Carbonization of John Norstad's <A HREF="http://charlotte.at.northwestern.edu/jln/progs.ssi">NewsWatcher</A>
program. It runs under Mac OS X or with CarbonLib 1.0.4.</P>

<H2>Where is it?</H2>

<P>You can download it <A HREF="NewsWatcher-X.sit.hqx">right here</A>. The
current version is 2.2.3a3.</P>

<H2>Does it work?</H2>

<P>As far as I know, it mostly works, and we even have a <A HREF="ScreenShot.jpeg">screen
shot</A>. I developed it under OS 9.0.4 and tested it under the public beta.
Not all the functionality has been tested. Several folks have stared testing
it under OS X and I try to respond promptly to serious problems.</P>

<H2>How do I report problems?</H2>

<P>Check out the <A HREF="problems.html">problems page</A>,which has directions
for filing bug reports.</P>

<H2>How do I pay for it?</H2>

<P>You don't. It is free and I did it for fun, to see how long it would
take and to give something back. If you really want to pay for it, please
send some money to your favorite charity. If you don't have one, try the
<A HREF="http://er-d.org/projectsforhope25.htm">Sanctuary Art Center</A>.</P>

<H2>Where is the source?</H2>

<P>I will be posting the source when it stabilizes. If you really really
want to patch something, let me know and I can mail it to you. (The real
problem is that we keep our web site in CVS and we are in the process of
upgrading the server drives and space is limited.)</P>
