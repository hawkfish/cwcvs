<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Description</H2>

<P>NewsWatcher-X is a carbonized version of John Norstad's <A HREF="http://charlotte.at.northwestern.edu/jln/progs.ssi">NewsWatcher</A>
program. NewsWatcher-X runs under Mac OS X or with CarbonLib 1.0.4. or later.
Have a look at the <A HREF="ScreenShot.jpeg">screen shot</A> to see what
it looks like under OS X.</P>

<P>NewsWatcher-X is available as freeware and you can <A HREF="NewsWatcher-X.sit.hqx">download</A>
it from our web site. The <A HREF="nwx.sit.hqx">source code</A> is also
available, and requires CodeWarrior Pro 7.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Functionality</H2>

<P>NewsWatcher-X works, but is not the most feature rich application you
will ever see. I developed it under OS 9.1 and have tested it under OS X
and OS X.1. Not all the functionality has been tested by me, but judging
by the number of downloads (over 20,000) and bug reports (under 30) I believe
it works quite well for what it does. I try to respond promptly to serious
problems.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Documentation</H2>

<P>The NewsWatcher 2.2.2 manual is available in both stand alone <A HREF=
"ftp://ftp.northwestern.edu/pub/newswatcher/user-doc.postcard.sea.hqx">postcard</A>
format and the proprietary <A HREF="ftp://ftp.northwestern.edu/pub/newswatcher/user-doc.msword.sea.hqx">Microsoft
Word</A> format.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Problems</H2>

<P>Check out the <A HREF="problems.html">problems page</A>,which has a list
of known problems, a list of fixed problems and directions for filing bug
reports.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Payment</H2>

<P>You don't. It is free and I did it for fun, to see how long it would
take and to give something back. If you really want to pay for it, please
send some money to your favorite charity. If you don't have one, try the
<A HREF="http://er-d.org/projectsforhope25.htm">Sanctuary Art Center</A>.</P>
