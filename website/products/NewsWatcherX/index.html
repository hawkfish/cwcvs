<H2>What is it?</H2>

<P>NewsWatcher-X is a Carbonization of John Norstad's <A HREF="http://charlotte.at.northwestern.edu/jln/progs.ssi">NewsWatcher</A>
program. It runs under the Mac OS X Public Beta or with CarbonLib 1.0.4.</P>

<H2>Where is it?</H2>

<P>You can download it <A HREF="NewsWatcher-X.sit.hqx">right here</A>. The
current version is 2.2.3b1. </P>

<P>NewsWatcher-X is also available in the following translations:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.sri.ucl.ac.be/jpk/logIntMacFr.html#news">Fran&ccedil;ais</A>
  (2.2.3a5).
</UL>

<H2>Does it work?</H2>

<P>As far as I know, it mostly works, and we even have a <A HREF="ScreenShot.jpeg">screen
shot</A>. I developed it under OS 9.0.4 and tested it under the public beta.
Not all the functionality has been tested. Several folks have stared testing
it under OS X and I try to respond promptly to serious problems.</P>

<H2>Is it documented?</H2>

<P>The NewsWatcher 2.2.2 manual is available in both stand alone <A HREF=
"ftp://ftp.northwestern.edu/pub/newswatcher/user-doc.postcard.sea.hqx">postcard</A>
format and the proprietary <A HREF="ftp://ftp.northwestern.edu/pub/newswatcher/user-doc.msword.sea.hqx">Microsoft
Word</A> format.</P>

<H2>How do I report problems?</H2>

<P>Check out the <A HREF="problems.html">problems page</A>,which has a list
of known problems, a list of fixed problems and directions for filing bug
reports.</P>

<H2>How do I pay for it?</H2>

<P>You don't. It is free and I did it for fun, to see how long it would
take and to give something back. If you really want to pay for it, please
send some money to your favorite charity. If you don't have one, try the
<A HREF="http://er-d.org/projectsforhope25.htm">Sanctuary Art Center</A>.</P>

<H2>Can I get the source?</H2>

<P>The source for the current build is <A HREF="nwx.sit.hqx">here</A>. It
requires CodeWarrior Pro 6 and Universal Headers 3.3.2 to build.</P>
