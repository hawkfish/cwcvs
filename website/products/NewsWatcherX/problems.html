<H2>Reporting Problems</H2>

<P>All reported problems are being tracked with a BugLink database. Before
reporting problems, please check the <A HREF="#known">known problems</A>.
Also, if you notice some resource related layout glitches, fixed resources
would be greatly appreciated.</P>

<P>The first choice is to use BugLink Reporter. Just <A HREF="BugReporter.sit.hqx">download</A>
the application and run it. You can then use BugLink Reporter to file bug
reports which I can import easily into BugLink.</P>

<P>You can also <A HREF="mailto:hawkfish@electricfish.com?Subject%3DNewsWatcher-X%20Bug%20Report">send
reports directly to me</A> if BugLink Reporter is too much of a pain to
use.</P>
