<H2>Reporting Problems</H2>

<P>All reported problems are being tracked with a BugLink database. Before
reporting problems, please check the <A HREF="#known">known problems</A>.
Also, if you notice some resource related layout glitches, fixed resources
would be greatly appreciated.</P>

<P>The first choice is to use the BugLink Reporter <A HREF="BugReporter.hqx">document</A>
which requires the <A HREF="http://www.pandawave.com/">PandaWave</A>'s <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.pandawave.com/pub/pandawave/bl/BL1_1_2.hqx">BugLink Reporter</A>
application. Copy the NewsWatcher-X BugLink Reporter document into the Data
folder next to the BugLink Reporter application. You can then use BugLink
Reporter to file bug reports which I can import easily into BugLink.</P>

<P>You can also <A HREF="mailto:hawkfish@electricfish.com?Subject%3DNewsWatcher-X%20Bug%20Report">send
reports directly to me</A> if BugLink Reporter is too much of a pain to
use.</P>
