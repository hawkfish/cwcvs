<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Reporting Problems</H2>

<P>All reported problems are being tracked with a BugLink database. Before
reporting problems, please check the <A HREF="#known">known problems</A>
and check what my <A HREF="#definition">definition</A> of a problem is.
Also, if you notice some resource related layout glitches, fixed resources
would be greatly appreciated.</P>

<P>The first choice is to use BugLink Reporter. Just <A HREF="BugReporter.sit.hqx">download</A>
the application and run it. You can then use BugLink Reporter to file bug
reports which I can import easily into BugLink.</P>

<P>You can also <A HREF="mailto:hawkfish@electricfish.com?Subject%3DNewsWatcher-X%20Bug%20Report">send
reports directly to me</A> if BugLink Reporter is too much of a pain to
use.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="definition"></A>What constitutes a problem?</H2>

<P>I am trying not to add features to NewsWatcher-X. That has already been
done admirably by Simon Fraser, Brian Clark and others who are Carbonizing
as we speak. So unless it severely impacts the functionality (e.g. Printing
and Navigation Services) the rule is that if the old NewsWatcher (2.2.2)
works that way, so does NewsWatcher-X. I am happy to listen to requests,
but this is the basic guideline.</P>

<P><A HREF="#possible">Possible problems</A> are ones that I cannot reproduce.
Any details would be helpful.</P>
