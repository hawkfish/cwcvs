<P><BR>
Single user, site, and worldwide licenses are available from <A HREF="http://order.kagi.com/?3UV">Kagi</A>.
You may use QTVRMatte without a license, but a green line will be drawn
across each frame. If you have any trouble at all with licensing, please
send mail to <A HREF="mailto:slithy@electricfish.com">slithy@electricfish.com.</A><BR>
<A NAME="anchor28758483"></A><BR>
A single user license is $50.<BR>
<BR>
A Site License costs $1000 (equal to 20 users) and covers all locations
for your organization within a 160 kilometer radius of your site (100 miles).
One big advantage of a Site License is that you do not need to keep track
of how many people at your site are using the software. <BR>
<BR>
A World-Wide License costs $4000 and it covers all locations for your organization
on the planet earth. Contact us about off-world licensing deals.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Place the &quot;Electric Fish&quot; folder which contains the QTVR Matte
  plug-in into the<BR>
  &quot;plug-ins&quot; folder in your After Effects folder. You must restart
  After-Effects for<BR>
  the plug-in to be visible. QTVR Matte should be visible in a group called
  &quot;EFish&quot;.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>QTVR Matte completely overwrites the layer to which it is applied. For
  this reason, you should create a new layer, instantiate a new solid in
  that layer, and apply QTVR Matte effect to that solid.<BR>
  <BR>
  When you first apply QTVR Matte, you will be prompted to select a Quicktime
  movie from the Macintosh standard-get-file dialog. Select a Quicktime movie
  which contains a panorama. You may change files / panoramas at any time
  by clicking on the &quot;options&quot; label in the Effects Window.<BR>
  <BR>
  Once you have selected a file which contains a panorama, you should see
  it overwriting the solid to which it was applied. You may then use the
  standard After Effects Controls in the Effects Window to manipulate the
  pan, tilt, fov, correction quality, and codec quality of the rendered panorama.
  <BR>
  <BR>
  Note that the initial default settings which QTVR Matte uses to bring in
  a movie may be less than optimal for pleasant viewing; you may have to
  adjust the field-of-view before you are able to see anything useful.</P>
