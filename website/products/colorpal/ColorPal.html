it. Place the &quot;Color Pal&quot; folder (which contains the Color Pal
plug-in) into the &quot;Plug-ins&quot; folder in your After Effects folder.
You must restart After Effects for the plug-in to be available. Color Pal
should be visible in the &quot;Window&quot; menu. </P>

<H3><A NAME="licensing"></A>Licensing</H3>

<P>Single user licenses are available from within the plug-in itself using
the eSellerate system. Upon purchase, your plugin will be licensed for use
with the copy of <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects/main.html">After
Effects</A> running at the time. A single user license is US $20.</P>

<H3><A NAME="licensing"></A>Registration</H3>

<P>Color Pal is distributed as &quot;trialware&quot;, which means that you
can use it for a seven day evaulation period. During that period, you will
be presented with a nag screen with a 10 second countdown you may either
cancel, purchase the product or wait for the timeout and click &quot;Not
Yet&quot;. After the evaluation period, the nag screen will only allow you
to purchase the product or cancel.</P>

<P><A HREF="#contents">Return to Contents</A><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H3><A NAME="use"></A>Use</H3>

<P>To activate Color Pal, simply choose it from the Window menu. There are
two parts to the Color Pal palette: the main palette and the &quot;hot chips&quot;.</P>

<P>The main palette is a scrolling list of 256 color chips at the top of
the Color Pal window.  These come initialized to a selection of colors in
the RGB color space. To change one of the chips, simply click on it to bring
up the color chooser, select a new color and click OK.</P>

<P>The &quot;hot chips&quot; are a row of eight colored rectangles along
the bottom of the Color Pal window. These come initialized to the primaries
white, black, red, green, blue, cyan, magenta and yellow. To change one
of them, simply click on it to bring up the color chooser, select a new
color and click OK.</P>

<P>The window can be resized to reduce the number of rows. When the number
of rows displayed in the main palette is smaller than the number in the
list, a scroll bar will appear to allow access to all the colors, unless
you have reduced the palette to the minimum size, in which case only the
hot chips will be visible.</P>

<P>When you quit <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects/main.html">After
Effects</A>, the colors you were using will be saved automatically so that
they will be available when you start your next session.</P>
