<H2>For Immediate Release</H2>

<P>Seattle, WA -- 13 November 2001</P>

<P>PLUG A COLOR PALETTE INTO AFTER EFFECTS</P>

<P>Electric Fish, Inc. is pleased to announce the release of Color Pal for
Adobe After Effects. Color Pal is a floating palette that provides quick
access to a user-configurable set of colors from within After Effects.</P>

<P>Color Pal can be used with any standard eye-dropper in After Effects
(e.g. composition background color, all color effect controls, solid color).
Just click on the eyedropper then click on the color of your choice in Color
Pal.</P>

<P>&quot;Video artists told us that Color Pal is a utility that should have
been part of After Effects,&quot; said Dav Lion, Co-President of Electric
Fish. &quot;Now they can have it as a seamless part of the application.&quot;</P>

<P>Color Pal works with After Effects 5.0 or later, and is available for
both Macintosh and Windows.</P>

<P>A fully functional 7-day trial version of Color Pal is available from
Electric Fish's web site at &lt;http://www.electricfish.com/products/colorpal/&gt;.
Users can purchase and register Color Pal directly from the plug-in for
$20.00.</P>
