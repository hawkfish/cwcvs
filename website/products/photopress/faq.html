<h3>What are the system requirements?</h3>
<blockquote>Power Macintosh<br>
32 megabytes of RAM<br>
Mac OS 8.6 or later; Mac OS X 10.0.4 or later<br>
CarbonLib 1.2 or later (or Mac OS X)<br>
QuickTime 4.0 or later</blockquote>

<h3>What printers does it support?</h3>
<blockquote>PhotoGrid is designed to work with any Macintosh printer. However, printers vary, so for best results, please follow the printer-specific directions below. 

<h4>Laser Printers (all models and manufacturers)</h4>
(Mac OS 8.6-9.x) If you are using a laser printer, please select the LaserWriter 8 driver from the Chooser.  

<h4>HP InkJet Printers</h4>
Turn Alternate Printing off from the Preferences dialog. 

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
Try changing the value of the Alternate Printing checkbox (choose "Preferences..." from the Edit menu or PhotoPress menu).  A few printer drivers require alternate printing, some don't work well with it.</blockquote>

<h3>Where can I buy it?</h3>
<blockquote>At present, you can <a href="InstallPhotoPress.bin">download a 30-day trial</a>, and purchase from within the application. (You'll need a credit card and an Internet connection.) We hope to offer more options soon.</blockquote>

<h3>Why can't I launch it?</h3>
<blockquote><h4>The application &quot;PhotoPress&quot; could not be opened because "CarbonLib" could not be found.</h4>
This error message can mean you have disabled extensions by holding down the Shift key at boot time -- restart and make sure CarbonLib is activated. Or you may need to run the Installer again.</blockquote>

<h3>I have more questions...</h3>
<blockquote>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:photopress@electricfish.com">photopress@electricfish.com</a>.</blockquote>
