<p><hr align=LEFT></p>

<h3>What are the system requirements?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Power Macintosh<br>
  32 megabytes of RAM<br>
  Mac OS 8.6 or later; Mac OS X 10.0.4 or later<br>
  CarbonLib 1.2 or later (or Mac OS X)<br>
  QuickTime 4.0 or <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">later</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>What printers does it support?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>PhotoGrid is designed to work with any Macintosh printer. However, printers
  vary, so for best results, please follow the printer-specific directions
  below.</p>
  <h4>Laser Printers (all models and manufacturers)</h4>
  <p>(Mac OS 8.6-9.x) If you are using a laser printer, please select the
  LaserWriter 8 driver from the Chooser.</p>
  <img src="prefs.gif" width="209" height="265" hspace="4" align="right" alt="Preferences dialog">
<h4>HP InkJet Printers</h4>
  <p>Turn Alternate Printing off from the Preferences dialog.</p>
  <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
  <p>Try changing the value of the Alternate Printing checkbox (choose &quot;Preferences...&quot;
  from the Edit menu or PhotoPress menu). A few printer drivers require alternate
  printing, some don't work well with it.</p>
<p>You might also want to experiment with changing Background Printing settings in the Print dialog.

<h3>I'm trying to print lots of pages, but only the first 16 print...</h3>
<blockquote>
Unfortunately, this is a limitation of the current version. Please split up your document. (Printing page ranges won't help.)
</blockquote>

<h3>Where can I buy it?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>At present, you can <a href="download.html">download a 30-day trial</a>,
  and purchase from within the application. Choose "About PhotoPress..." and click the "Buy" button (or use the "Buy" button when the application starts up). You'll need a credit card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover/Novus) and an Internet connection.
<p>
We hope to offer more options soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Can I use it under both OS X and OS 9?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Yes. You will need to reinstall it:
<ol>
<li>Purchase PhotoPress while running OS X (or OS 8.6/9.x)
<li>Check your e-mail to receive a purchase confirmation
<li>Launch PhotoPress while running OS 8.6/9.x (or OS X)
<li>Click the "Buy" button
<li>Hold down the Option key and click the "Start" button (it will change to "Reinstall")
<li>Enter your e-mail address and order number
</ol></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Why can't I install it?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A few people have had trouble running the Installer unless they restart with no extensions (hold down the shift key at startup time).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Why can't I launch it?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <h4>The application &quot;PhotoPress&quot; could not be opened because
  &quot;CarbonLib&quot; could not be found.</h4>
  <p>This error message can mean you have disabled extensions by holding
  down the Shift key at boot time -- restart and make sure CarbonLib is activated.
  Or you may need to run the Installer again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>I have more questions...</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@electricfish.com">support@electricfish.com</a>. (Send any suggestions for improvements to this address as well.)
<p>
If you're having trouble running the program, it's helpful to include as much information as possible about your system configuration. Some useful information is in the About box.
